# 10,000 Days Of Discipline: Symbiotic, BioMimetic Neuroarchitecture

*Maybe you just want to start by reading some of the notes on our thinking captured in [the daily journal of this PKM process](Journal.md).* Or, maybe you'd find that a little unnerving or overwhelming ... or *just plain useless*.

The daily "ground rules" for this project will be the [Kaizen 5S method for daily home decluttering](https://leanfactories.com/how-to-declutter-your-home-using-the-5s-organization-method/):

* [Seiri (Sort)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Eliminate the unnecessary.
* [Seiton (Set in Order)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): A place for everything, and everything in its place.
* [Seiso (Shine)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Clean the workspace (the entire home).
* [Seiketsu (Standardize)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Create a consistent, standard process.
* [Shitsuke (Sustain)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): "Internalize each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".
