# 10,000 Days Of Discipline: Symbiotic, BioMimetic Neuroarchitecture

The goal of truly elegant, simple habitat design is about the practice of implementing a symbiotic, biomimetic neuroarchitecture that supports our health, creativity and productivity over the next 10,000 days at least, or more if we live that ... the time horizon of this large PROJECT of projects is approximately 35 years, until at least 2060 ... and beyond. 

Our emphasis on elegance and resilience pushes us to our anti-materialist, anti-affluent abhorence of comfort ... a preference for discipline is rooted in the knowledge that discipline equals freedom. This means that we are building an old school martial arts dojo and structure for continual martial arts arts training. 

Freedom is about not making decision that build prisons, but daily discipline also involves not only physical decluttering but also mental and digital decluttering for the purposes of spiritual sharpening, fostering an environment that promotes creativity, but primarily clarity and FOCUS on the soul ... RATHER than a structure for housing maintenance-intensive appliances, intrusion-rich automation systems and habitat for gadgets, gizmos and annoyances.

*Maybe you just want to start by reading some of the notes on our thinking captured in [the daily journal of this PKM process](Journal.md).* Or, maybe you'd find that a little unnerving or overwhelming ... or *just plain useless*.

As a strategic matter to inculcate LEAN discipline, this project will be knowledge-intensive as opposed to being investment-intensive; our knowledge will primarily be aimed at lowering expenses and resource consumption, reducing or eliminating needs for investment and generally simplifying and eliminating, rather than adding new activity or new levels of waste. As a practical matter, each day will involve new research, but the daily "ground rule" or default daily physical task list for this project is 45 minutes of 5S activities focused on a particular room or area of the house OR, weather permitting 45 minutes of repositioning bags of flowers/herbs, weed pulling, digging/transplanting or shovelling snow.

To think LEAN is to continuously build LEAN discipline ... discipline equals freedom ...  our LEAN discipline will be a refelection of the Kaizen 5S methods that we research and develop, starting with a basis of imitation of [how others have applied 5S for daily home decluttering](https://leanfactories.com/how-to-declutter-your-home-using-the-5s-organization-method/):

* [Seiri (Sort)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Eliminate the unnecessary.
* [Seiton (Set in Order)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): A place for everything, and everything in its place.
* [Seiso (Shine)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Clean the workspace (the entire home).
* [Seiketsu (Standardize)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Create a consistent, standard process.
* [Shitsuke (Sustain)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): "Internalize each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".
