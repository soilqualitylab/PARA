# Ecosystem-Level Mimicry

## Metadata

This Project was created on `2025` `11` `12` with the template located at `.foam/templates/projects.md` in an attempt to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md). 


## Introduction

This sprint moves [beyond mimicking just single organisms](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/archuht/article/1070/&path_info=Hammond_Utilizing_Biomimicry_to_Design_Sustainable_Architecture_Honors_Capstone_Final.pdf) to [mimicking the "six principles" of a biomicry spiral in an entire economically-sustainable ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetic_architecture#Biomimicry_Spiral). This involves researching [how natural ecosystems "run smoothly" through diversity, feedback loops, and resource recycling.](https://www.learnbiomimicry.com/blog/biomimicry-lifes-principles) Applying the knowledge from this area programs the mindset to think in systems as in 'DevOps' strategic thinking, ensuring the house and landscape function as one interdependent, self-regulating entity. This research is the core of the 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy and applying "ecosystem" principles to sustainable architecture which will drive the entire larger 10,000 days project of 100 projects ... the first deliverable for each of these project areas is a backlog list of 100 daily tasks. 

**Daily** tasks are all about internalizing the discipline of this philosophy ensures every design choice aims for "mutual harmony" with the natural environment. As you will recollect, the **daily** "ground rules" for this project will be the [Kaizen 5S method for daily home decluttering](https://leanfactories.com/how-to-declutter-your-home-using-the-5s-organization-method/):

* [Seiri (Sort)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Eliminate the unnecessary.
* [Seiton (Set in Order)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): A place for everything, and everything in its place.
* [Seiso (Shine)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Clean the workspace (the entire home).
* [Seiketsu (Standardize)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Create a consistent, standard process.
* [Shitsuke (Sustain)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): "Internalize each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".
