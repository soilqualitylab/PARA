# Biomimicry vs Symbiosis

## Metadata

This Project was created on `2025` `11` `12` with the template located at `.foam/templates/projects.md` in an attempt to optimize the machine-readability for automating notes in the future, using [note properties](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/note-properties.md), [templates](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/templates.md), and [graph visualization](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/docs/user/features/graph-view.md).

## Introduction

This topic researches the core philosophical difference between [biomemetic architecture which learns from nature's principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetic_architecture) and [designing for mutualism with symbiotic architecture](https://medium.com/@azha.khan.6/symbiotic-architecture-designing-for-mutualism-between-humans-nature-and-technology-89c9b5e9e043) The point of this project is to understand the area will enough to define the primary 'Lighthouse Vision' of the home as a "living participant" in its ecosystem, not just a clever machine or nifty artistic structure that appears to be functional. This research helps to set up daily tasks which provide hands-on programming to instill a disciplined mindset that is about "giving back as much as it takes or spends", not just lowering costs, but also forming the basis of the key anti-materialist 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy for sustainable architecture which drive the entire larger 10,000 days project of 100 projects ... the first deliverable for each of these project areas is a backlog list of 100 daily tasks. 

**Daily** tasks are all about internalizing the discipline of this philosophy ensures every design choice aims for "mutual harmony" with the natural environment. As you will recollect, the **daily** "ground rules" for this project will be the [Kaizen 5S method for daily home decluttering](https://leanfactories.com/how-to-declutter-your-home-using-the-5s-organization-method/):

* [Seiri (Sort)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Eliminate the unnecessary.
* [Seiton (Set in Order)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): A place for everything, and everything in its place.
* [Seiso (Shine)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Clean the workspace (the entire home).
* [Seiketsu (Standardize)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Create a consistent, standard process.
* [Shitsuke (Sustain)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): "Internalize each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".
