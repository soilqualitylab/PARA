# Adaptive Building Envelopes

This sprint researches "biomimetic principles for the development of adaptive architectural envelopes".20 This 'Skin' 8 layer will be designed to respond to the environment passively, like a biological membrane, rather than actively through "machine" 14 systems. This research directly links the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy to the 'Pace Layering' (9%) framework.8 It programs a mindset of "life-friendly chemistry" 19 and "low energy processes" 19 from the home's very "skin." 

## Daily Tasks

**Daily** tasks are all about internalizing the discipline of this philosophy ensures every design choice aims for "mutual harmony" with the natural environment. As you will recollect, the **daily** "ground rules" for this project will be the [Kaizen 5S method for daily home decluttering](https://leanfactories.com/how-to-declutter-your-home-using-the-5s-organization-method/):

* [Seiri (Sort)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Eliminate the unnecessary.
* [Seiton (Set in Order)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): A place for everything, and everything in its place.
* [Seiso (Shine)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Clean the workspace (the entire home).
* [Seiketsu (Standardize)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): Create a consistent, standard process.
* [Shitsuke (Sustain)](https://www.testahomes.com/en/the-kaizen-method-keep-your-house-clean-and-tidy-3/): "Internalize each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".

### GitHub Functionality For Discussions, Issues, Projects

In addition to VS Code and the Foam extension, we will rely upon the GitHub Discussion and Issue functionality, BEFORE graduating something to "Project" status ... when something becomes a Project on GitHub, it will simultaneously become a PROJECT in our P.A.R.A. hierarchy. Please abide by the GitHub progression from ... [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) ...to... [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) ...to... [Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects):

* [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) are mainly for just discussing something, to clarify terminology or ask questions or for just generally speculative thinking out loud.

* [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) are for things that somebody really needs to look into and possibly turn into more of a Project.

* [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) are adaptable task-boards or roadmaps that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan, visualize and track your work effectively. 

### P.A.R.A. Project Mgmt Review

The *holy grail* of the PKM project investigations or [emergent phenomena](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Understanding_Emergence/List_of_emergent_phenomena) is possibly something like [emergent neuromorphology or sparking something embryonic morphogenesis](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMi1jb3B5_08973e84-67af-4db9-a382-2292404a8b74) in complex organisms like humans which starts with cells migrate via gradients; then adhesion sorts types and shapes organs such that incredibly complex physiological lifeforms elegantly emerges from relatively simple cues. The patterns or behaviors we seek from new research discoveries would ***noteworthy*** when are not explicitly programmed or predictable from the properties of individual components, but rather emerge as a result of their interactions ... such that a better, more complete understanding of emergence OR new components might be ***useful***. 

A Project is the start of a bigger development commitment and the basis of the P.A.R.A. method of the [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/) methodology. The P.A.R.A. ***methodological architecture*** systematically manages information differently than mere notetaking apps:

* **PROJECTS**, have SMART goals, minimal completion reqmts and deadlines
* **AREAS** are about roles/responsibilities or obligations or capabilities ... **Areas** are the preferred destination for **Projects**.
* **RESOURCES**, mostly finished AREAS, but also ongoing interests, assets, future inspiration, may req continual maintenance and refactoring but, for now, are *backburner*able  ... **Resources** are the preferred destination for **Areas**.
* **ARCHIVES**, inactive matl from P A R that is kept around only for informational purposes.

## Project Goals

*Specific, Measurable, Aggressive, Realistic, Timebound objectives ... these are GOALs for stretching what we hope to achieve, rather than non-negotiable, minimal-acceptable ultimatums as Requirements and Deadlines are*.

## Project Requirements

*We aggressively manage the scope of Projects for MINIMAL VIABILITY requirements for completion and handed-off advancement to the Areas section.*.

## Project Deadlines

*Time DEADLINES are not goals, but rather firm drop-dead dates after which we don't bother anymore*.
