### **Epic 1: Symbiotic Foundations (The 'Bio-Mimetic' & 'Utilidor' Strategies)**

*(This epic lays the 35-year philosophical and physical groundwork. It combines the 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy with the 10% 'Foundational Platform' and 9% 'Pace Layering' strategies.)*

1. Biomimicry vs. Symbiosis
   This sprint researches the core philosophical difference between learning from nature's principles 9 and designing for mutualism with it.10 This will define the primary 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9) of the home as a "living participant" 10 in its ecosystem, not just a clever machine. This research programs the mindset to "give back as much as it takes" 10, forming the basis of the anti-materialist 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy. This philosophy ensures every design choice aims for "mutual harmony" 10 with the natural environment.  
2. Ecosystem-Level Mimicry  
   This sprint moves beyond mimicking single organisms 14 to mimicking the "six principles" 9 of an entire ecosystem. This involves researching how natural ecosystems "run smoothly" 9 through diversity, feedback loops, and resource recycling.19 This programs the mindset to think in systems (Strategy \#2, 'DevOps'), ensuring the house and landscape function as one interdependent, self-regulating entity. This research is the core of the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy, applying "ecosystem" 9 principles to architecture.  
3. Home as a "Living Organism"  
   This sprint investigates synthetic biology 16 and living building systems to conceptualize the home's "metabolism," "lungs," and "breathing".15 This involves researching how to use "photosynthesis of plants and algae" 15 for energy/air quality and how the home can "respond to changes in the external environment" 15 like an organism. This research programs the mindset to treat the house as a biological partner to be "cultivated" and cared for, not a static object to be owned. This is the literal implementation of the 'Symbiotic' 10 strategy.  
4. Architectural Symbiosis: Case Studies 17  
   This sprint analyzes built precedents like the 'Symbiotic House' in Taiwan 27 and the 'Orquideorama' botanical garden.17 The research focuses on designs that "blur boundaries between the inside and out" 27 and "make no distinction between natural and artificial".17 This provides a visual and practical library of "patterns" for achieving a symbiotic, non-materialist aesthetic rooted in "regional culture".27 This "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research ensures the final design is both beautiful and philosophically "symbiotic".27  
5. Residential Utilidor Design 13  
   This sprint researches the engineering, "substantial upfront investment" 13, and legal "feasibility" 61 of a human-accessible "utility corridor" 13 for a single-family residence. This is the core 'Foundational Platform' (Strategy \#10), which "significantly reduces the need for future excavations".13 This research "front-loads" the effort (Strategy \#10), programming a 35-year mindset of proactive maintenance and easy refactoring, as all utility work becomes a "light" task. This is the physical "chassis" for the 10,000-day project.  
6. Pace Layering in Residential Architecture 7  
   This sprint involves a deep study of Stewart Brand's 6 'S' layers: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff.8 This research provides the essential temporal framework for the 35-year project, understanding that "different parts... change at different speeds".7 This programs the mindset for long-term thinking 107, ensuring that "fast" layers 8 are not "obstructed" by "slow" layers.8 This is the 'Pace Layering' (Strategy \#9) in action.  
7. De-coupling Services from Structure 8  
   This is a critical synthesis sprint, focusing on the intersection of 'Pace Layering' 8 and the 'Utilidor'.13 The research is on how to design the connection points—the "service ports" (Strategy \#7)—that allow the "fast" 'Services' layer 8 (plumbing, data) to be upgraded within the 'Utilidor' 13 without disturbing the "slow" 'Structure' layer.8 This design work is the key to the 35-year resilience of the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (Strategy \#2) plan, enabling non-disruptive "refactoring" (Strategy \#3).  
8. Adaptive Building Envelopes 20  
   This sprint researches "biomimetic principles for the development of adaptive architectural envelopes".20 This 'Skin' 8 layer will be designed to respond to the environment passively, like a biological membrane, rather than actively through "machine" 14 systems. This research directly links the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy to the 'Pace Layering' (9%) framework.8 It programs a mindset of "life-friendly chemistry" 19 and "low energy processes" 19 from the home's very "skin."  
9. 'Modular Zone' (Microservice) Architecture 52  
   This sprint applies the software concepts of "microservices" 52 and "modular" code 66 to the physical 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7). This involves designing "standardized utility ports" (Strategy \#7) for each room (kitchen, dojo, studio), so each "zone" can be independently "refactored" or "published." This research programs the mindset for 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) development, allowing one "microservice" 52 (e.g., the "artist's studio") to be upgraded without taking the whole system "offline." This is the micro-level implementation of 'Pace Layering'.8  
10. The 'Digital Twin' (Simulation-First) Strategy  
    This sprint researches the software (e.g., Building Information Modeling \- BIM) and methods for creating a 1-to-1 "Digital Twin" (Strategy \#2) of the physical home. This simulation will be the 'sandbox' environment where all 'Kaizen' 11 improvements, 'n-of-1' 89 experiments, and 'Agile Refactoring' (Strategy \#3) sprints are "tested virtually before physical work" (Strategy \#2). This "simulation-first" (Strategy \#2) 'DevOps' 12 practice minimizes waste, "automates" 12 planning, and "programs" a mindset of "measure twice, cut once" for the 35-year project.
