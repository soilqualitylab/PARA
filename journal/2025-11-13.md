### **Epic 1: Symbiotic Foundations (The 'Bio-Mimetic' & 'Utilidor' Strategies)**

*(This epic lays the 35-year philosophical and physical groundwork. It combines the 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy with the 10% 'Foundational Platform' and 9% 'Pace Layering' strategies.)*

1. [Biomimicry vs. Symbiosis](01BiomimicryVSymbiosis) 9  
   This sprint researches the core philosophical difference between learning from nature's principles 9 and designing for mutualism with it.10 This will define the primary 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9) of the home as a "living participant" 10 in its ecosystem, not just a clever machine. This research programs the mindset to "give back as much as it takes" 10, forming the basis of the anti-materialist 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy. This philosophy ensures every design choice aims for "mutual harmony" 10 with the natural environment.  
2. [Ecosystem-Level Mimicry](1.Projects/staging/02EcosystemLevelMimicry)  
   This sprint moves beyond mimicking single organisms 14 to mimicking the "six principles" 9 of an entire ecosystem. This involves researching how natural ecosystems "run smoothly" 9 through diversity, feedback loops, and resource recycling.19 This programs the mindset to think in systems (Strategy \#2, 'DevOps'), ensuring the house and landscape function as one interdependent, self-regulating entity. This research is the core of the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy, applying "ecosystem" 9 principles to architecture.  
3. [Home as a "Living Organism"](1.Projects/staging/03HomeAsLivingOrganism)  
   This sprint investigates synthetic biology 16 and living building systems to conceptualize the home's "metabolism," "lungs," and "breathing".15 This involves researching how to use "photosynthesis of plants and algae" 15 for energy/air quality and how the home can "respond to changes in the external environment" 15 like an organism. This research programs the mindset to treat the house as a biological partner to be "cultivated" and cared for, not a static object to be owned. This is the literal implementation of the 'Symbiotic' 10 strategy.  
4. Architectural Symbiosis: Case Studies 17  
   This sprint analyzes built precedents like the 'Symbiotic House' in Taiwan 27 and the 'Orquideorama' botanical garden.17 The research focuses on designs that "blur boundaries between the inside and out" 27 and "make no distinction between natural and artificial".17 This provides a visual and practical library of "patterns" for achieving a symbiotic, non-materialist aesthetic rooted in "regional culture".27 This "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research ensures the final design is both beautiful and philosophically "symbiotic".27  
5. Residential Utilidor Design 13  
   This sprint researches the engineering, "substantial upfront investment" 13, and legal "feasibility" 61 of a human-accessible "utility corridor" 13 for a single-family residence. This is the core 'Foundational Platform' (Strategy \#10), which "significantly reduces the need for future excavations".13 This research "front-loads" the effort (Strategy \#10), programming a 35-year mindset of proactive maintenance and easy refactoring, as all utility work becomes a "light" task. This is the physical "chassis" for the 10,000-day project.  
6. Pace Layering in Residential Architecture 7  
   This sprint involves a deep study of Stewart Brand's 6 'S' layers: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff.8 This research provides the essential temporal framework for the 35-year project, understanding that "different parts... change at different speeds".7 This programs the mindset for long-term thinking 107, ensuring that "fast" layers 8 are not "obstructed" by "slow" layers.8 This is the 'Pace Layering' (Strategy \#9) in action.  
7. De-coupling Services from Structure 8  
   This is a critical synthesis sprint, focusing on the intersection of 'Pace Layering' 8 and the 'Utilidor'.13 The research is on how to design the connection points—the "service ports" (Strategy \#7)—that allow the "fast" 'Services' layer 8 (plumbing, data) to be upgraded within the 'Utilidor' 13 without disturbing the "slow" 'Structure' layer.8 This design work is the key to the 35-year resilience of the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (Strategy \#2) plan, enabling non-disruptive "refactoring" (Strategy \#3).  
8. Adaptive Building Envelopes 20  
   This sprint researches "biomimetic principles for the development of adaptive architectural envelopes".20 This 'Skin' 8 layer will be designed to respond to the environment passively, like a biological membrane, rather than actively through "machine" 14 systems. This research directly links the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy to the 'Pace Layering' (9%) framework.8 It programs a mindset of "life-friendly chemistry" 19 and "low energy processes" 19 from the home's very "skin."  
9. 'Modular Zone' (Microservice) Architecture 52  
   This sprint applies the software concepts of "microservices" 52 and "modular" code 66 to the physical 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7). This involves designing "standardized utility ports" (Strategy \#7) for each room (kitchen, dojo, studio), so each "zone" can be independently "refactored" or "published." This research programs the mindset for 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) development, allowing one "microservice" 52 (e.g., the "artist's studio") to be upgraded without taking the whole system "offline." This is the micro-level implementation of 'Pace Layering'.8  
10. The 'Digital Twin' (Simulation-First) Strategy  
    This sprint researches the software (e.g., Building Information Modeling \- BIM) and methods for creating a 1-to-1 "Digital Twin" (Strategy \#2) of the physical home. This simulation will be the 'sandbox' environment where all 'Kaizen' 11 improvements, 'n-of-1' 89 experiments, and 'Agile Refactoring' (Strategy \#3) sprints are "tested virtually before physical work" (Strategy \#2). This "simulation-first" (Strategy \#2) 'DevOps' 12 practice minimizes waste, "automates" 12 planning, and "programs" a mindset of "measure twice, cut once" for the 35-year project.

### **Epic 2: Kaizen-DevOps Operations (The 35-Year Process)**

*(This epic defines the 'how'—the daily operational philosophy for the 10,000-day project. It merges the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) and 'Agile' (12%) strategies.)*

11. Kaizen Philosophy for Home Life 11  
    This sprint studies the core philosophy of 'Kaizen' 11 as "continuous improvement" 47 applied to "our social life, our home life".49 It is "founded on the idea that small, incremental changes routinely applied... result in significant improvements".11 This research trains the mindset to see every "atomic daily task" 51 not as a chore, but as an opportunity for a "change for the better".50 This is the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) strategy in its purest form.  
12. The 5S Methodology for Domestic Space 50  
    This sprint is a deep dive into the practical 5S method: Seiri (Sort), Seiton (Set in Order), Seiso (Shine), Seiketsu (Standardize), and Shitsuke (Sustain).50 This is the "how-to" for the daily 'Kaizen' 11 tasks, creating a "place for everything, and everything in its place".56 This system "programs" the "dojo mindset" 37 of "cleanliness" 37, order, and efficiency into the entire domestic environment, from the kitchen 50 to the workshop.56  
13. DevOps Principles for Physical Systems 12  
    This sprint researches how to translate 'DevOps' principles 12 from software to the physical home. This includes "Automation" 12 of home systems, "Continuous Feedback" 12 (e.g., sensors in the permaculture garden), "Version Control for All Assets" 12 (via the 'Digital Twin', Strategy \#2), and "End-to-End Responsibility".12 This research provides the "operations" 69 half of the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) strategy. It programs a mindset of "systems thinking" 54 and "continuous improvement".53  
14. 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11  
    This sprint synthesizes the core 15% strategy. It's about designing a "holistic approach" 69 where every 45-minute "maintenance" task 11 also includes a "refactoring" component.12 The research will focus on process design: "How does this 'Kaizen' 11 task 15 provide "feedback" 12 that allows me to "refactor" the system to be better?" This "programs" a mindset of "continuous evolution" (Strategy \#2).  
15. Agile Refactoring (Scrum) for Home Projects  
    This sprint studies 'Agile' 12 and 'Scrum' (Strategy \#3) methodology and applies it to the home. This involves setting up 7-year "Epochs" (Strategy \#8) as "Releases," 1-year "Refactoring Sprints" (Strategy \#3), and 2-week "Sprints" for daily tasks. The 10,000 tasks will be managed in a "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5). This 'Agile' (12%) strategy "programs" the 35-year project, making it manageable, "iterative" (user query), and "adaptive" 19 to "unexpected" 19 changes.  
16. Homesteading as a Kaizen Practice 51  
    This sprint researches how the 'Kaizen' 51 philosophy is applied on "year-round vegetable farm\[s\]" 60 to manage the "list that only ever gets larger".59 This directly addresses the "homesteading" 87 goal. This research "programs" the mindset to reframe the "overwhelming" 59 nature of homesteading from a source of stress into the perfect engine for "continuous, incremental improvements" 51 ('Kaizen', 15%).  
17. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Home Systems 63  
    This sprint researches the software side of the 'Utilidor' (10%) strategy. It involves learning 'IaC' 63 tools 66 to "programmatically" manage the home's "smart" systems.8 This means treating the home's configuration "the same way developers treat code" 63, making it "repeatable" 65 and "versioned".63 This is the 'DevOps' 12 "automation" 64 principle applied to the "chassis".13  
18. The 'Dynamic Backlog' (AI-Curated) Strategy  
    This sprint investigates AI assistant tools (like GPT-4, etc.) that can "curate" (Strategy \#5) the 10,000-task "Dynamic Backlog" (10%). The AI will be tasked with scanning for "new tech" (Strategy \#5) (e.g., new 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 materials, new 'n-of-1' 89 tracking tools) and "suggesting" (Strategy \#5) new 'Kaizen' 11 tasks that align with the 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9). This "programs" the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) "continuous evolution" (Strategy \#2) by automating the "search for improvements."  
19. The 'Epoch' (Technological Era) Strategy  
    This sprint is for planning the 35-year project in 7-year "Epochs" (Strategy \#8). This "refactoring sprint" (Strategy \#3) involves defining the "Tech Stack" (Strategy \#8) for "Epoch 1" (e.g., current solar, 'IaC' 63 tools) and forecasting the "Great Refactor" (Strategy \#8) for "Epoch 3" (e.g., replacing Gen1 solar with Gen3 perovskite solar). This 'Pace Layering' 8 approach "programs" the mindset to expect and plan for technological "revolutions" 7 rather than be disrupted by them.  
20. The 'Lighthouse Vision' (Dynamic Roadmap) Strategy  
    This is the "meta" sprint, focused on the process of reviewing the 'Lighthouse Vision' (3%) itself. This "annual review" (Strategy \#9) ensures the 35-year "why" 107 remains fixed, while the "how" (the 'Dynamic Roadmap', Strategy \#9) is "refactored yearly based on new tech" (Strategy \#9). This sprint "programs" the discipline of 'Kaizen' 11 and 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) "self-renewal" 19 into the project's highest level, ensuring the 10,000-day project never deviates from its "anti-materialist" (user query) core.

### **Epic 3: Neuro-Programming & The Studio (The 'Artist's Studio' & Mind)**

*(This epic focuses on the user's primary goal: "programming" the mindset for creativity, art, music, and flow. It is the implementation of the neuroarchitecture and embodied cognition research.)*

21. Neuroarchitecture: The Core Principles 5  
    This sprint researches the fundamentals of how "spatial layout, material use, color, and acoustics" 5 directly "impact... the nervous system, emotions, and human behavior".5 This is the foundational "neuro-architecture" 70 science for designing a "programming" environment. This research "programs" the "designer" 39 mindset, providing the scientific evidence 70 that "design can directly influence... cognitive and emotional experiences".3 This is the mechanism for the 'Dojo' 37 lifestyle.  
22. Embodied Cognition and Architecture 2  
    This sprint is a philosophical and practical study of how "the body... constitute\[s\] or contribute\[s\] to cognition" 29 and how the "built environment... interacts with multisensory body-related processing".30 The research will be used to design spaces that demand "mindful" 2 interaction. This "programs" the user's mind through their "mindful body" 2, "connecting... movements with emotions and memories" 2 as a daily practice.  
23. Disrupting Habit: 'Attentional Switches' 3  
    This sprint focuses on a specific neuro-architectural tactic: designing spaces (like "Scarpa's stairs," 3, or "door\[s\]," 2\) that "disrupt habitual movements".3 This "disruption" acts as an "attentional switch" 3, creating "time delays" 3 that "allow users to consciously experience their surroundings".3 This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) of presence, pulling the user out of "mind-wandering" 31 and into the "present moment".3  
24. Designing for Creative Flow State 34  
    This sprint studies the neuroscience of "flow" 34, which is "a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter".34 Neuroimaging shows this "flow state" 34 involves the 'default-mode network' and a "release of control".34 The "artist's studio" 36 will be designed to facilitate this, with "expansive" spaces 32 and sensory stimuli 33 that encourage this "letting go".34 This "programs" the artist 7 mindset.  
25. The Parasympathetic 'Rest and Digest' Environment 43  
    This sprint researches how to design spaces that actively balance the user's nervous system, promoting the "parasympathetic response (a.k.a Rest and Digest)" 43 over the "sympathetic response (a.k.a Fight or Flight)".43 This is crucial for recovery from 'HIIT' 77 training and "creative flow" 34 work. The research will focus on "mindfully designed spaces" 4338 that "amplify the rest and digest mode" 43, "programming" calm and recovery.  
26. Neuroarchitecture of the Artist's Studio 34  
    This sprint synthesizes the research into a practical design for the "artist's studio".36 This space will be a "flow-inducing" 34 environment, using "natural light" 32, "color" 35, and "intuitive circulation flow" 33 to "stimulate... creativity".35 This research "programs" the artist's 7 'kata' 4: the 'Dojo' 37 creates focus, while the 'Studio' 36 creates flow.34  
27. Biophilic Design for Acoustics 71  
    This sprint researches "Biophilic Acoustic Design" 71 for the user's "music" interest. It involves using "living plants," "green walls" 73, and natural materials 71 as "superior sound dampeners" 71 that are more effective than "dead" wood.71 This "programs" the "music studio" as a 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 space, creating an "acoustically "restorative" 43 environment that "reconnect\[s\] workers with the natural world".73  
28. Designing for 'Pleasure Reading' 32  
    This sprint focuses on a specific "anti-materialist" (user query), anti-internet goal. It involves designing a "reading nook" based on neuroarchitecture.32 This will be an "intimate space" 32 with "soft and neutral colour palette\[s\]," 33 "sensory comfort" 33, and 'biophilic' 40 views. This "programs" the mindset to make "reading books for pleasure" (user query) the most desirable and "restorative" 43 activity, competing with "internet scrolling" (user query).  
29. The Architecture of Sculpture 17  
    This sprint researches the "Element of Form" 110 and "Space" 74 in relation to the user's "sculpture" interest. This involves designing the landscape 27 and 'Potager' 86 itself as a large-scale sculpture garden, "blurring boundaries" 27 between 'Site' 8, 'Art' 7, and 'Structure'.8 This "programs" the mindset to see the "entire property" 22 as a "work-in-progress" (user query) "artist's studio".36  
30. 'Psychological Canvas' of the Home 75  
    This sprint researches the concept of a home as a "psychological canvas".75 This philosophical sprint ties the entire epic together, reframing the "artist's studio" not as one room, but as the entire property. The "lived-in" (user query) 'Dojo' 37 "actively participants" 75 in the user's "mental and emotional journeys".75 This "programs" the mindset by "harness\[ing\] the power of... surroundings to support... profound personal transformation".75

### **Epic 4: The Biophilic Dojo (The 'Martial Arts' Mindset & Body)**

*(This epic implements the "dojo lifestyle" goal. It synthesizes the philosophy of a traditional dojo with biophilic design and modern, high-intensity training protocols.)*

31. Philosophy of Dojo Space 1  
    This sprint researches the traditional "philosophy of space in the dojo" 1, where "discipline define\[s\] the design".37 This includes the 'Shomen' (front wall), 'Kamidana' (shrine) 46, "calligraphy scrolls," 37 and the core "dojo culture" 37 values of "order," "simplicity," 37 and "cleanliness at the core".37 This research "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) by building an "authentic" 37 space that "respects tradition".37  
32. Designing for Kata and Reflection 4  
    This sprint moves beyond a "home gym" 41 and focuses on designing for "kata" 4 and "reflection".76 This requires "proper space planning" 76 with "enough space for movement" 76 (e.g., 'tai-sabaki' 4 or body management). The design will be non-distracting, with a "minimal" 37 'flow' 37 that "programs" the "mindful body" 2 for "individual martial art practice".4  
33. The Biophilic Gym: Core Principles 40  
    This sprint researches the core principles of "biophilic design" 40 for "wellness facilities".41 This involves using "natural light," "air-purifying plants" 40, and "natural materials" 4042 to create a "harmonious relationship between humans and the built environment".40 This research "programs" the "Dojo" 37 as a space that "enhances physical health" 40 and "reduces stress".41  
34. 'Nature Gyms' and 'Green Exercise' 41  
    This sprint investigates the "Green Gym" 44 concept, which moves beyond just putting plants in a room 40 to integrating the exercise with the outdoors.41 This provides the model for the 'Biophilic Dojo' 37, which will "blur boundaries" 27 between the indoor training space and the 'Permaculture' 23 landscape. This "programs" the "HIIT" 77 workout as an interaction with "nature".41  
35. Integrating Tabata Training 77  
    This sprint researches the "Tabata" 77 protocol 77 and how to design the environment for it. This involves creating a "safe" 78 outdoor/indoor 'Dojo' 37 space, potentially "in the park" 78 (the 'Permaculture' 23 landscape). The design will focus on "joint-friendly support" 4537 for the "all-out effort" 78 bursts.  
36. Integrating 4x4 Norwegian Training 77  
    This sprint researches the "Norwegian 4x4" 77 protocol 77 to "maximize cardiovascular health".77 This sprint will focus on designing the 'Site' 8 layer for this: creating a 'Dojo-Nature' 44 running or cycling "path" 76 on the property that allows for sustained 4-minute intervals at 85-95% max heart rate.77 This "programs" the landscape 8 itself as a "tool" 58 for 'VO2 Max' 80 training.  
37. The 'Biophilic Dojo' Synthesis 37  
    This is a key 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) design sprint. It's about resolving the "contradiction" 68 between the "austere, minimal" 'Dojo' 37 and the "rich, complex" 'Biophilic' 40 design. The research will focus on "balancing tradition with modern design" 37 to create a space that has the "authenticity" 37 and "soul" 37 of a 'Dojo' 46 and the nervous-system-calming 41 benefits of a 'Nature Gym'.44  
38. Dojo as a Community Space 37  
    This sprint researches the 'Dojo's 37 role as a "community" 46 space that "fosters community and flow".37 This links the 'Dojo' 46 epic to the 'Service' 102 epic. This research "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 as a dual-use 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7): it is a 'Sanctuary' 38 for private 'kata' 4, but also a 'Service' 104 space for public 'peer support' 103 and 'sponsorship'.105  
39. Biophilic Design for Home Training 41  
    This sprint researches the specifics of 'Biophilic Design' 41 for a home gym 41, not a commercial one. This involves "indirect biophilia" 4242 and 'natural materials' 42 to "enhance motivation" 40 and "reduce stress" 41 in a "smaller" 41, "focused" 32 'Dojo' 37 space. This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) by connecting it to the 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9).  
40. Dojo 5S 37  
    This sprint applies the '5S' 'Kaizen' 56 principles 55 to the 'Dojo' 37 itself. This links the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) epic to the 'Dojo' 37 epic. The 'Dojo's "cleanliness at the core" 37 will be the model for the '5S' 56 "Standardize" 50 principle for the entire 'Symbiotic Home'.10 This "programs" the mindset: the 'Dojo' 37 is the '5S' 56 "practice".56

### **Epic 5: The Permaculture Potager (The 'Homesteading' & 'Garden' Life)**

*(This epic implements the "permaculture," "gardening," and "homesteading" goals. It reframes the garden as a "living dojo" and a place of mindfulness, directly supporting the 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy.)*

41. Permaculture Philosophy as a Worldview 24  
    This sprint researches permaculture "not \[as\] a variation of organic gardening" 24, but as a "way to view the world" 81 and a "design system" 21 for "sustainable human environments".21 It is the "art of making connections" 24 and "noticing systems".81 This "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) mindset, grounding the 10,000-day project in the "Earth Care" 23 ethics.  
42. Permaculture as Mindful Practice 31  
    This sprint focuses on the mindset programming of permaculture. It's about "intentional observation" 81 and "mindful attention".81 "Gardening" 31 is reframed as a "meditative practice" 31 that cultivates "being present" 31 and a "flow state".82 This "programs" the mind to observe the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 system, "identify patterns" 82, and "apply self regulation and accept feedback".8112  
43. The 'Potager' (Kitchen Garden) Philosophy 83  
    This sprint researches the history and design of the French "potager".85 It is not a "farm".60 It is an aesthetic "tasting garden" 83 that "intermingle\[s\] vegetables, fruits, herbs, medicinal... and flowers" 85 in "symmetrical" 112 beds. This "programs" the "artist's studio" 36 mindset, reframing the "homesteading" 87 goal as an act of art.7  
44. Designing the Potager 'Dojo' 83  
    This sprint defines the 'Potager' 85 as a "living dojo".37 The design will be "symmetrical" 112, "enclosed" 83, and "a space you do not want to leave".84 The "daily tasks" 83 (planting, weeding, harvesting) are the 'kata' 4 of this 'Dojo'.37 This "programs" the mindset by "painting a picture with plants" 86, turning "maintenance" (user query) into a "meditative practice" 31 of "creativity".86  
45. Homesteading 101: Core Practices 87  
    This sprint researches the foundational "homesteading" 87 skills. This includes "methods of food preservation" 87 (canning, dehydrating), "self-sufficiency" 87, and daily "animal care".8888 This research provides the content for the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11 "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5) of daily tasks. This "programs" the practical "homesteading" 87 lifestyle.  
46. Integrating Permaculture and Biophilic Design 23  
    This sprint explores the "symbiotic" 10 relationship between permaculture 21 and 'biophilic design'.23 The 'Potager' 83 will be designed as the primary 'biophilic' "view" 40 from the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Studio'.36 This "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy, "reconnecting people with nature" 23 by visually and functionally "blurring boundaries".27  
47. Urban & Residential Agriculture Policy 26  
    This is a practical 'Governance' 113 layer sprint into local "zoning policy".26 This research is necessary to ensure the "homesteading" 87 and "permaculture" 26 goals 26 are legally viable (Strategy \#4, 'Legal Paperwork') on the 'Site'.8 This "programs" the 'Kaizen' 11 mindset of "planning and preparation".11  
48. Vertical Gardening and Trellising 84  
    This sprint researches how to "utilize every space" 84 in the 'Potager' 83 by "growing vertically".84 This involves using "natural material" 8484 and "salvaged material" 84 to create "arches" 84 and "teepee trellis\[es\]".84 This "programs" the "artist's" 86 and 'Kaizen' 1119 mindsets, "adding... depth to the space" 84 while maximizing "self-sufficiency".87  
49. 'Fair Share' 23 and Regenerative Living 28  
    This sprint focuses on the "permaculture ethic" 23 of "Fair Share": "equitably distributing resources and sharing surplus".23 This involves researching systems for "regenerative living" 28 and "sharing" 23 the 'Potager' 83 harvest. This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, linking the 'Potager' 83 (production) to the 'Service' 102105 epic.  
50. The 'Zone 0' Permaculture/Architecture Link 25  
    This sprint researches the "boundary between permaculture and architecture".25 Permaculture's "Zone 0" is the house.25 This sprint will analyze how to design the 'Structure' 8 and 'Skin' 8 of the house itself as the "center of the permaculture system".21 This "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy at the deepest level, making the "house" 15 and "garden" 83 "one symbiotic, self-refactoring system" (Strategy \#1).

### **Epic 6: The Lab & Larder (The 'N-of-1' Research & 'Homesteading' Practice)**

*(This epic focuses on the user's "practical research" goals. It creates spaces for "n-of-1" experiments, "tinkering," and "food preservation," merging the "lab" and the "workshop.")*

51. 'N-of-1' Trial Methodology 89  
    This sprint researches the "n-of-1" 89 or "do-it-yourself" 91 clinical trial methodology. This "single-patient" 89 approach is the scientific method for the 35-year project, providing a "controlled trial" 89 framework for "personalized nutrition research".89 This "programs" the "researcher" (user query) mindset, rejecting "conventional 'one-size-fits-all' approach\[es\]".89  
52. Designing the Home 'N-of-1' Lab 92  
    This sprint is about designing the space for "n-of-1" experiments.89 This "lab" 93 will be designed to support "home-based exercise programme\[s\]" 92 and the tracking of "biometric data".9393 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Kitchen' 95 as "labs" 93 to "optimize... workouts, and diet".93  
53. The 5S Kaizen Workshop 56  
    This is the 'Tinkering' and 'Maintenance' (user query) sprint. It involves applying the '5S' 'Kaizen' 56 methodology to the workshop.56 The goal is "A place for everything, and everything in its place".56 This "programs" the "tinkering" (user query) mindset, creating an "organized and productive" 56 space where "tools" 57 are accessible, "less time" 57 is wasted, and "maintenance" 94 is "effortless".50  
54. Designing the Fermentation Lab 95  
    This sprint researches the spatial requirements for a "fermentation kitchen".95 This "food preservation" 87 lab 96 involves "regulation of temperatures" 95, "large sink" 95 prep areas, and "cave" 95 or "root cellar" storage. This "programs" the "homesteading" 87 lifestyle by creating a "lab" 96 for "nurturing conditions" 96 for "beneficial microorganisms".9695  
55. Fermentation Science: Lactic Acid 96  
    This sprint researches the science of "lactic acid" 96 fermentation for "sauerkraut and kimchi".96 This is the 'n-of-1' 89 "practical research" (user query) for "personalized nutrition".89 This "programs" the "scientist" mindset, "managing microbes" 96 to "improve... absorb\[tion\] of... nutrients" 96 and "gut-health".96  
56. Food Preservation: Canning 98  
    This sprint researches the "canning process" 98, which "involves placing foods in jars... and heating them to a temperature that destroys microorganisms".98 This sprint also includes the safety and legal requirements 99 (e.g., "test\[ing\] it at an approved commercial laboratory" for "pH of 4.6 or lower," 99). This "programs" the "homesteading" 87 "self-sufficiency" 87 lifestyle, ensuring the "food preservation lab" 95 is safe and "effective".90  
57. The Workshop as 'Root Cause Analysis' Hub 58  
    This sprint links the 'Kaizen' 58 philosophy to the 'Tinkering' workshop.56 The workshop will be the "lab" 93 for 'Root Cause Analysis' 5858 for any "failure" in the 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 home. When something breaks, the process is to "tinker" (user query) until the root cause is found and "refactored".12 This "programs" a mindset of solving problems 58, not just fixing symptoms.  
58. The 'Larder' as a Data Source 87  
    The "food preservation" 87 "larder" (pantry) will be designed as part of the 'N-of-1' Lab.89 This 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint involves designing a "pantry" that is also an inventory system.55 This provides "data" 93 for the user's "self-sufficiency" 87 metrics 11 and "n-of-1" nutritional experiments.89 This "programs" the 'Homesteading' 88 lifestyle as a 'Data-Driven' 93 practice.  
59. Tools and Maintenance as Kaizen 11  
    This is a philosophical sprint about reframing "tinkering, tools, maintenance" (user query). These are not "chores".50 They are the core of the 'Kaizen' 11 "continuous improvement" 47 process. The '5S Workshop' 56 is the "Dojo" 37 for this practice. This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) of discipline and respect for one's "tools" 57 and "environment".56  
60. N-of-1 vs. 'One-Size-Fits-All' 89  
    This is a foundational "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research sprint into the philosophy of "personalized nutrition".89 This rejects the "conventional 'one-size-fits-all' approach" 89 that defines the "affluent materialist" (user query) lifestyle. This research "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, fully embracing the 'N-of-1' 89 "experimental" 93 "Dojo" 37 lifestyle.

### **Epic 7: The Sanctuary & Service (The 'Spiritual' & 'Sponsorship' Life)**

*(This epic implements the "spiritual matters and solitude" and "sponsorship" goals. It focuses on designing for two "non-materialist" modes: deep solitude and active peer support.)*

61. The Architecture of Solitude 38  
    This sprint researches architects like Luis Barragán, who championed "solitude as good company".38 This research "goes against the grain" 38 of modern design that "shuns" 38 "intimate communion with solitude".38 The goal is to design "spaces of solitude" 38 that "slow... down" 38 and create "meditative emptiness" 38, using the home as a "psychological canvas".75 This "programs" the "spiritual matters" (user query) goal.  
62. The 'Contemplative Designer' Framework 39  
    This sprint studies the "Contemplative Designer" framework 39 to learn how to "intentionally create spaces of deeper connection".39 This research provides the method for designing 'Sanctuary' 38 spaces that "induce dramatic changes in... brain patterns" 39 similar to "long term contemplative practitioners".39 This "programs" the designer 39 mindset, "cultivat\[ing\] 'internal' technologies" 39 of "empathy" 39 and "wonder".39  
63. Designing the 'Urban Monastery' 101  
    This sprint analyzes "urban monastery" 101 designs as a 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 case study. This research focuses on using materials 101 and "fine and fragile" 101 details to "blur... scales" 101 and "encourage a state of contemplation".101 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) aesthetic, "balancing tradition" 37 with a "monastic" 101 focus on "solitude and reflection".101  
64. Designing for Peer Support 102  
    This is the "Service" (user query) sprint. It involves researching the spatial needs of "peer support services" 104 and "support groups".103 This is not "clinical" 104 design. It is about "designing... peer recovery support" 102 spaces that are safe, non-hierarchical, "community asset\[s\]" 102, and "foster... mutually beneficial relationships".102 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 as a "community space".46  
65. The Architecture of 'Sponsorship' 104  
    This sprint focuses on the "sponsorship" (user query) goal, which is "foundational" 105 to recovery. This requires a space that supports a '1-on-1' "shared lived experience".105104 The design must foster trust and vulnerability, drawing on the "safe harbor" 102 principles of recovery spaces. This "programs" the service (user query) aspect of the "anti-materialist" (user query) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9).  
66. Dual-Mode Space: The 'Sanctuary-Service' Synthesis 38  
    This is the key design challenge of this epic. It's about designing a 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) that can be both a 'Sanctuary' for "intimate communion with solitude" 38 and a 'Service' space for "peer support groups".103 The design must be functionally modular, transforming 8 from one to the other without compromising the "psychological safety" 75 of either mode. This "programs" the flexibility 11 of the 'Dojo'.37  
67. 'Asset-Based Community Development' 102  
    This sprint researches the "asset-based community development" 102 theory. This is the philosophy for the "service" goal. The 'Symbiotic Home' 10 itself will be "mapped" as a "natural asset" 102 for the "recovery community".102 This "programs" the 'sponsorship' 105 goal, "foster\[ing\] mutually beneficial relationships" 102 and fulfilling the 'Permaculture' 23 'Fair Share' 23 ethic.  
68. Responsible Finance \[User Query\]  
    This is a practical 'Governance' 113 layer sprint on "responsible finance" (user query). This involves researching "anti-materialist" (user query) financial models (e.g., 'Financial Independence', 'Minimalism', 'Bogleheads') to ensure the 35-year, "high upfront cost" 13 'Utilidor' 13 project is financially sustainable. This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset into the funding 113 of the 'Symbiotic Home'.10  
69. Correspondence and Legal \[User Query\]  
    This is a 'Kaizen' 11 sprint on "correspondence" and "legal paperwork" (user query). This involves designing a '5S' 56 "office" space and a process 50 for handling these 'Governance' 113 layer tasks. This "programs" efficiency 11 into the "boring" 59 tasks, "eliminating waste" 11 so they don't disrupt the 'Flow' 34 of the 'Artist' 7 layer.  
70. Resurrection and Accountability \[User Query\]  
    This is the final, philosophical "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) sprint. This is about researching the meaning of "resurrection" and "accountability" (user query) as actions 102, not just "worship activities" (user query). This research will form the ethos of the 'Service' 104 mission. This "programs" the purpose 47 of the 10,000-day 'Dojo' 37 project.

### **Epic 8: A 30-Topic "Refactoring" Backlog**

(This final epic provides 30 additional "sprints" that synthesize and extend the first 70\. These are more specific, 'n-of-1' 89 experiments that can be pulled into the "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5) at any time. They directly implement the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11 "refactoring" mindset.)

71. Refactor Sprint: 'Pace Layer' 8 Audit  
    This sprint designs the process for the "mandatory 'Refactoring Sprint'" (Strategy \#3) review of the 6 'Pace Layers'.8 This "annual" (Strategy \#3) 'Agile' 12 review "programs" the 35-year 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) mindset. It asks: "Is the 'Services' 8 layer 'refactoring' (Strategy \#3) as fast as 'Commerce' 113 demands? Is the 'Structure' 8 layer 'remembering' 7 its 'anti-materialist' (user query) goal?"  
72. Refactor Sprint: Biophilic 'Nature Gym' 44 Iteration  
    This sprint is a 'Kaizen' 11 "blitz" 11 to add a new 'biophilic' 40 element (e.g., an outdoor 'HIIT' 78 "stair" 78 or "green turf" 45 area) to the 'Dojo'.37 This will be followed by an 'n-of-1' 89 experiment to test its "stress-reducing" 41 effects on '4x4' 77 "recovery".77 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 as a 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "continuously improving" 47 space.  
73. Refactor Sprint: Potager 'Dojo' 84 Aesthetics  
    This is a 'Kaizen' 11 sprint to refactor one bed of the 'Potager' 83 for purely aesthetic 86 reasons. This involves "painting a picture with plants" 86 using "color palettes" 86 and "textures".84 This "programs" the "artist's" 7 mindset, overriding the 'homesteading' 87 "productivity" 11 mindset, "balancing" 37 'Art' 7 and 'Commerce' 113 (food production).  
74. Refactor Sprint: 5S 'Kaizen Blitz' 11  
    This sprint is a "rapid improvement process" 1111 on a new 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) (e.g., a closet, the 'Larder' 87). This involves fully implementing the '5S' 56 method from scratch.50 This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) of "order" 37 and "discipline" 37 as an active, repeating 'Kaizen' 11 "event".11  
75. N-of-1 Lab 89: Tabata 78 vs. 4x4 77  
    This is a "practical research" (user query) 'n-of-1' 89 experiment sprint. It compares the biometric 9377 and perceived 92 "stress" 41 effects of a 6-week 'Tabata' 78 block vs. a 6-week '4x4' 77 block. This "programs" the "researcher" 89 mindset, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the 'Dojo' 37 training plan 92 based on "data".93  
76. N-of-1 Lab 89: Fermentation 96 and Mood  
    This is an 'n-of-1' 89 sprint to track the correlation between consuming specific fermented foods 9695 from the 'Fermentation Lab' 95 and daily mood 41 and cognitive flow 34 metrics.

77. N-of-1 Lab 89: Solitude 38 and Creativity  
    This is an 'n-of-1' 89 sprint to test the 'Sanctuary' 38 design. This involves tracking "creative flow" 3434 on days with and without a programmed "hour of solitude" 38 in the 'Sanctuary' 38 space. This "programs" the discipline of 'solitude' 38, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the daily schedule based on "data" 93 proving its "creative" 34 value.  
78. Neuro-Programming 32: Light Hacking 32  
    This sprint "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the 'Services' 8 layer by researching and implementing a "circadian lighting system".40 This system "programs" the user's 'biorhythms' 40 by "follow\[ing\] the body's natural rhythm" 40 ("blue-white tones" 40 by day, "amber tones" 40 by night). This 'Neuroarchitecture' 32 "hack" enhances "focus" 32 and "productivity" 40 "by day" 40 and "sleep by night".40  
79. Neuro-Programming 32: Soundscape Design 72  
    This sprint "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the 'Studio' 71 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) by designing a 'biophilic' soundscape.106 This 'Neuroarchitecture' 32 sprint involves "introducing sounds from the natural world" 72106 to mask "unwanted noise" 73 and "enhance... focus".32 This "programs" the 'Studio' 71 as a "calm" 41 'Sanctuary'.38  
80. Symbiotic System 10: Water Recycling 15  
    This is a 'Bio-Mimetic' 19 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Services' 8 layer by implementing a greywater or "living machine" 15 water recycling system. This 'Kaizen' 11 "refactor" improves the 'symbiosis' 10 of the 'House as Organism' 15 by "recycl\[ing\] all materials".19 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) "ethos" 28 of "resource efficiency".19  
81. Symbiotic System 10: Soil Food Web 23  
    This is a 'Potager' 83 sprint to research the "Soil Food Web".23 This 'Kaizen' 11 task involves "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the 'Site' 8 layer by starting a "no-till" 60 "composting" 23 system. This "programs" the "permaculture" 81 mindset of "stewardship" 28 by "nurturing the soil" 23 and "programming" the health 81 of the 'Potager Dojo' 84 itself.  
82. Symbiotic System 10: Designing for Pollinators 26  
    This is a 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Potager' 86 and 'Site' 8 by designing for "pollinators".26 This "enhances biodiversity" 10 and "rewards cooperation" 19 (Strategy \#1). This "programs" the mindset to see the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 as a node in a larger "ecosystem" 9, fulfilling the 'Earth Care' 23 ethic.  
83. Dojo 37: 'Kata' 4 Creation  
    This is an 'Embodied Cognition' 2 sprint to create a new, personal 'kata'.4 This "kata" will be a "sequence of... meaningful movement" 2 that traverses the entire 'Dojo-Potager-Studio' 36 'microservice' 52 loop. This "programs" the mind-body-home connection 2 at the deepest 'Embodied' 29 level, "blurring boundaries" 27 between 'self' 30 and 'space'.30  
84. Dojo 37: Weapon (Bokken/Jo) Kata  
    This is a 'Dojo' 37 sprint to research traditional weapon 'kata'.4 This connects the user to the "martial arts mindset" (user query) and "heritage".37 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 with "authenticity" 37, and the "wooden weapons racks" 37 themselves become part of the '5S' 56 "Set in Order" 55 'Dojo' 46 design.  
85. Kaizen 11: The '5 Whys' 58  
    This is a 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint to practice the '5 Whys' 58 'root cause analysis' 58 tool. The next time a "maintenance" (user query) issue arises 59, this sprint involves asking "why" five times to find the systemic root cause. This "programs" the "researcher" 89 mindset, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the system (e.g., "the '5S' 56 'Shine' 50 process... is inadequate") instead of the symptom.  
86. Kaizen 11: 'Value Stream Mapping' 58  
    This sprint is to research 'Value Stream Mapping'.58 This 'Kaizen' 11 "analytical technique" 11 involves "creating a visual representation" 58 of a single 'homesteading' 87 process.87 This map is then used to "identify and eliminate waste".11 This "programs" the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "efficiency" 11 mindset.  
87. Service 102: 'Asset Mapping' 102  
    This is a 'Sanctuary-Service' 102 sprint to perform the "asset mapping" 102 research. This involves identifying other "community... assets" 102102 that support recovery. This "programs" the 'Sponsorship' 105 mission as an outward-facing 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "collaboration" 12, "build\[ing\] stronger connections" 102 and "foster\[ing\] mutually beneficial relationships".102  
88. Service 104: Hosting a 'Peer Support' 103 Meeting  
    This is a "capstone" 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) "release" for the 'Service' 102 epic. This involves designing and hosting a "peer support group" 103 in the 'Sanctuary-Service' 38 space. This tests the "dual-mode" 38 design (Epic 7, Topic 66\) in a "real-world" scenario, "programming" the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 as a true "community asset".102  
89. Studio 35: 'Biophilic Art' 42  
    This is an 'Artist's Studio' 36 sprint to research "indirect biophilia" 42 and "natural analogues".7272 This involves creating a piece of "sculpture" (user query) or "art" 35 that is inspired by the "biomimetic" 9 forms found in the 'Potager' 83 or 'Site'.8 This "programs" the "artist's" 7 mindset, "connecting haptic experiences and memories" 2 to the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9).  
90. Studio 71: Music and Nature 72  
    This is a 'Music' (user query) sprint to compose a piece of music in the 'Biophilic Acoustic' 71 studio. This composition will use "soundscape" 106 "acoustic recording\[s\]" 106 from the 'Symbiotic' 10 landscape. This "programs" the "artist's" 7 "creative flow" 34 by "blurring boundaries" 27 between the 'Artist' 7 'Pace Layer' 7 and the 'Nature' 7 'Pace Layer'.7  
91. Refactor Sprint: 'Anti-Materialist' (User Query) 'Sort' 55  
    This is an "annual" (Strategy \#3) 'Kaizen' 11 sprint to re-perform the '5S' 55 Seiri 55 step for the entire home. This "refactor" (Strategy \#3) is purely 'anti-materialist' (user query) and 'philosophical'.24 Its purpose is to "eliminate unnecessary items" 55 and "curb excesses from within".19 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, actively "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the "conventional affluent" (user query) "Stuff" 8 layer.  
92. Refactor Sprint: 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) Update  
    This is a 'DevOps' 12 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) itself. This involves updating the 3D model, the 'IaC' 63 scripts, and the 'n-of-1' 89 "data" 93 logs. This "programs" the "Kaizen" 11 mindset of 'Seiso' 50, ensuring the simulation (Strategy \#2) remains a 1-to-1, "reliable" 63 copy of the physical 'Symbiotic Home'.10  
93. N-of-1 Lab 89: 'Pneumo-visual' 30 Interaction  
    This is an advanced 'Neuro-Programming' 32 sprint. It involves researching "multisensory body-related inputs" 30 like "pneumo-visual" 30 (breath-to-sight) feedback. This "n-of-1" 89 "tinkering" (user query) experiment will "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Sanctuary' 38 with 'bio-feedback' 93 sensors and 'circadian' 40 lighting. This "programs" a deeper 'Contemplative' 39 state by "alter\[ing\]... self-location" 30 ("programming the mindset").  
94. N-of-1 Lab 89: 'Cardio-visual' 30 Interaction  
    This is a sister sprint to \#93, for the 'Dojo'.37 This 'n-of-1' 89 "tinkering" (user query) experiment will 'refactor' (Strategy \#3) the 'Dojo' 37 with "cardio-visual" 30 (heartbeat-to-sight) feedback. This tests 93 if visualizing the 85-95% max heart rate 77 biophilically 40 (e.g., as a pulsing "living" 15 light-form) improves '4x4' 77 training adherence and "programs" a "mindful body".2  
95. Kaizen 11: 'Shitsuke' (Sustain) 50  
    This is a purely philosophical 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint on the 5th 'S': Shitsuke.50 This is the "martial arts mindset" (user query) applied to 'Kaizen'.11 It's about researching how to "make the improvements a permanent part of the... culture" 58 and "internalise each step".50 This "programs" the end-goal of the 10,000-day project: to make the 'Dojo' 37 lifestyle "effortless" 34, not "laborious".50  
96. Pace Layering 7: The 'Culture' 8 Layer  
    This is a 35-year "slow" 7 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) sprint. This involves researching the 'Culture' 8 layer of the 'Pace Layer' 7 model. This "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the user's "anti-materialist" (user query) identity by "connecting... memories" 2 and "ancestors" 24 to the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Potager' 85 practices. This "programs" the cultural 113 "why" (Strategy \#9) of the 10,000-day project.  
97. Pace Layering 7: The 'Nature' 8 Layer  
    This is the slowest 7 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) sprint. This is the 'Site' 8 layer. This 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 sprint involves researching the 'geological' 8 and deep time 107 history of the 'Site' 8 itself. This "programs" the "Dojo" 37 mindset to align with the 'Nature' 7 layer, the "slow \[layer that\] has all the power".7  
98. Refactor Sprint: 'Epoch 1' (Strategy \#8) Review  
    This is a 7-year 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) sprint. This is the "Great Refactor" (Strategy \#8) planned in sprint \#19. It involves a full 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 review of the "Tech Stack" (Strategy \#8) and 'Permaculture' 22 systems. This sprint "programs" the long-term 'Kaizen' 11 by using the 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) to plan the "refactor" (Strategy \#3) of the next 7-year 'Epoch' (Strategy \#8).  
99. The 'Lighthouse' 107 Itself  
    This is a philosophical 'meta' 107 sprint. This involves reading Stewart Brand's The Clock of the Long Now 68 and other 'Long Now' 7 foundation texts. This research "programs" the mindset for the "10,000-day" (35-year) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9). This "reframes" the "anti-materialist" (user query) 'Dojo' 37 'Kaizen' 11 project as a vital "responsibility" 107 in a "networked world where everything seems to be about speed".107  
100. The 'Dynamic Backlog' (Strategy \#5) Itself  
     This is the final 'meta' sprint. This involves refactoring the backlog (this very list). This 'Agile' 12 "self-organize" 19 task uses the 'AI-Curated' (Strategy \#5) 'Dynamic Backlog' (Strategy \#5) to "add/delete tasks" (Strategy \#5) from this list, based on the results 12 of the first 'n-of-1' 89 sprints. This sprint closes the loop, turning the 10,000-day 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) process back onto itself, achieving a true "continuous evolution" 12 "symbiotic" 10 system.
