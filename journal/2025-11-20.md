The KEY of the abundance of riches offered by AI is that **simple, ordinary lists really matter** as context for prompting agentic AI ... especially when it's something deeply personal like asking an AI help with self-coaching and self-awareness.

To explore the brand new "Dynamic View" functionality from GoogleLabs, I gave the newly announced release Gemini 3.0 Pro the following prompt:

*As a retired 66-year-old still-fit engineer who appreciates really understanding the full ishikawa of the different factors, nuances, interactions driving EVERY single thing that happens in life, I believe that the best measure of how healthy one is probably depends upon one's own self-coaching, self-awareness and ability to really dig in and enjoy the full significances of even the most basic, ordinary tasks -- not just to ask WHY we're doing that task in that way, but to consider speedier, more efficient processes for doing it better.  Engineering is about continuous improvement of the ordinary things that people take for granted ... especially as one ages. In other words, one has to stay busy with puttering on micro-projects including tougher, new material such as working on AI research/development -- but the all-around measure of health and fitness may come from just being more present and aware while engaging in small activity breaks [that one takes AWAY from the computer, away from AI, away from Git] to get some exercise and generally keep things, especially the aging body, working well ... and to notice opportunities for where one is getting unfit, rusty, less strong.  Please examine the following Daily Journal Notes at https://soilqualitylab.github.io/PARA/Journal.html to understand the larger background behind this request; especially ingest the attached list, ie yesterday's PARA journal entry, as context for this prompt and expand upon and develop that list with insights, tricks, different ways to be even more aware and engaged in continually "training" or keeping everything fit throughout the home, throughout one's life.  When you develop an app for this list, please be sure to allow for editing and changing of the exact description of the activity item.*

I tried a couple iterations ... these are the best versions so far, but I might try more.

I can't kick about the agentic AI's output at all ... but agentic AI is like a calculator or even a programmable scientific calculator with all kinds of functions ... the information that one gets out of the tool is totally dependent on the data one puts in.

In other words, the weakness is very much on my list of inputs or 200 tasks, which is only an AI-brainstormed list ... synthetic psuedo-data that I used to test the functionality of the AI, so of course, I can probably improve this input and redo list by just using it and thinking more deeply about my tasks on the list as I do might little activity breaks ... the KEY of this whole thing is how it drives home what I guess I already knew that **simple, ordinary lists really matter** as context for prompting agentic AI to help with self-coaching and self-awareness.
