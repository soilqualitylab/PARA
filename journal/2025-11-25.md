Maximizing value per unit, depends on long-term building of LIVING soils, in order to enable the future ability to maximize value and that demands a LIVING soil with an ecosystem of soil building organisms that will will continue converting organic material to soil organic material.

It's impossible to overstate the value of a great LIVING soil on any piece of ground next to a dwelling; if you had to purchase 1/2 cubic foot of garden soil, you would spend at least $10/cubic foot for great soil or $50,000 to cover 10,000 square ft with just 6" of soil but that's ONLY a start, a cover of dead soil that will soon disappear. A covering of ***dead*** soil would still be grossly insufficent compared to in situ development of LIVING ecosytems necessary to support future building of LIVING soil ... it's not just the soil or the inert materials, but rather it's the healthy LIVING ecoystems supporting FUTURE building of LIVING SOILS.

There are many examples of what kinds of things you can do on bare, suburban fill ... but mostly it requires PATIENCE -- henbit (*Lamium amplexicaule*) might be the best example which illustrates this, but there are others to consider:
