Maximizing value per unit, depends on long-term building of LIVING soils, in order to enable the future ability to maximize value and that demands a LIVING soil with an ecosystem of soil building organisms that will will continue converting organic material to soil organic material.

It's impossible to overstate the value of a great LIVING soil on any piece of ground next to a dwelling; if you had to purchase 1/2 cubic foot of garden soil, you would spend at least $10/cubic foot for great soil or $50,000 to cover 10,000 square ft with just 6" of soil but that's ONLY a start, a cover of dead soil that will soon disappear. A covering of ***dead*** soil would still be grossly insufficent compared to in situ development of LIVING ecosytems necessary to support future building of LIVING soil ... it's not just the soil or the inert materials, but rather it's the healthy LIVING ecoystems supporting FUTURE building of LIVING SOILS.

There are many examples of what kinds of things you can do on bare, suburban fill ... but mostly it requires PATIENCE -- henbit (*Lamium amplexicaule*) might be the best example which illustrates this, but there are others to consider: 

## Edible Perennials with Soil-Building Properties

1. **Horseradish** (*Armoracia rusticana*): This aggressive, deep-rooted perennial breaks up compacted subsoil while producing pungent edible roots, with its vigorous taproot mining minerals from 3–6 feet deep and depositing them in upper layers as leaves decompose. It tolerates neglect exceptionally well, going dormant during drought and re-emerging when moisture returns, making it ideal for zero-maintenance corners. Over 10–20 years, its biomass cycling can contribute 0.5–1% SOM annually in a 10-square-foot area while providing continuous harvests.

2. **Red Raspberries** (*Rubus idaeus*): These cane-forming brambles create dense thickets that trap leaves and build humus layers, with their shallow, spreading roots forming mycorrhizal partnerships that enhance nutrient cycling. The biennial canes die back naturally, contributing woody debris that feeds fungal networks while new canes emerge, creating a self-sustaining carbon pump. Birds distribute seeds widely, and the plants provide early summer berries, pollinator habitat, and 2–4 tons of biomass per acre annually that decomposes into rich topsoil.

3. **Black Raspberries** (*Rubus occidentalis*): More drought-tolerant than red varieties, these arching canes root at their tips to form expanding colonies that stabilize slopes and create wildlife corridors. Their deeper root systems access subsoil moisture during dry spells, making them resilient pioneers that can colonize disturbed areas with minimal care. The purple-black berries are prized by 40+ bird species, ensuring widespread natural propagation while the dense cane structure holds snow for spring moisture and contributes 1–2 inches of leaf litter decomposition annually.

4. **Sour Cherries** (*Prunus cerasus*): These small trees sucker freely to form groves, creating extensive root networks that stabilize soil while producing abundant fruit with minimal pest pressure compared to sweet cherries. Their early spring blossoms feed emerging pollinators when few other resources exist, and the suckering habit means they regenerate after damage or drought stress. Over 30–40 years, a single original plant can expand to cover 200+ square feet, with annual leaf drop and fruit waste contributing significant organic matter while shading out aggressive weeds.

5. **Riverbank Grapes** (*Vitis riparia*): This native wild grape climbs existing vegetation to create vertical habitat layers, with its extensive root system diving 10–20 feet deep to access water and bring up nutrients through leaf fall. The vines provide late-season fruit for wildlife, dense summer shade that cools soil and retains moisture, and massive amounts of carbon-rich woody growth that can be pruned and dropped as mulch. Unlike cultivated varieties, riverbank grape thrives on neglect, naturally balancing vigor with available resources and forming thickets that exclude invasive species.

6. **Aronia Berries** (*Aronia melanocarpa*): These native shrubs form spreading colonies via root suckers, creating dense 4–6 foot stands that capture and hold autumn leaves while producing antioxidant-rich berries. Their fibrous root systems stabilize soil exceptionally well, tolerating both flooding and drought while hosting beneficial mycorrhizae that extend benefits to neighboring plants. The white spring flowers support early pollinators, fall foliage turns brilliant red, and the persistent berries feed overwintering birds through March, with each mature plant contributing 20–30 pounds of leaf litter annually.

7. **Elderberries** (*Sambucus canadensis*): Fast-growing shrubs that sucker aggressively to form thickets, elderberries excel at colonizing wet, disturbed areas while producing umbels of edible flowers and vitamin-rich berries. Their hollow stems die back regularly, creating instant habitat for native bees while decomposing rapidly to feed soil organisms. Elderberry roots host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, effectively fertilizing surrounding soil, and a mature stand can produce 100+ pounds of organic matter annually while providing three-season wildlife value.

8. **Hazelnuts** (*Corylus americana*): Native shrubs forming 8–12 foot thickets that produce edible nuts, fix nitrogen through bacterial associations, and create exceptional wildlife habitat with dense branching structure. Their aggressive suckering forms living fences that trap wind-blown leaves and snow, building deep organic layers while the spring catkins provide critical early pollen for bees. Over 20–30 years, a hazelnut thicket can transform bare soil into rich woodland understory conditions, sequestering 30–50 tons of carbon per acre while yielding annual nut crops with zero inputs.

9. **Chokecherries** (*Prunus virginiana*): Suckering small trees that rapidly colonize disturbed ground, forming groves that stabilize soil while producing astringent but edible fruits beloved by 50+ bird species. Their deep taproots access subsoil water during drought, allowing them to maintain green foliage when other species wilt, and this moisture pumping enriches surface soils through leaf fall. The white spring flower clusters are critical for native pollinators, and mature groves generate 3–5 tons of leaf litter per acre annually while shading out most weeds.

10. **Wild Strawberries** (*Fragaria virginiana*): Low-growing groundcover that spreads via runners to form dense mats, stabilizing bare soil while producing intensely flavored small berries and attracting numerous pollinator species. The plants remain evergreen in protected spots, providing year-round photosynthesis and soil coverage, while their shallow roots form extensive mycorrhizal networks that benefit companion plants. Each mother plant can generate 20+ daughter plants annually, allowing rapid colonization of 100+ square feet within 3–5 years while adding continuous organic matter through runner and leaf senescence.

## Nut and Mast-Producing Trees

11. **Bur Oak** (*Quercus macrocarpa*): Massive, long-lived trees with taproots extending 20+ feet deep, mining minerals and building topsoil through centuries of acorn and leaf drop. Their thick, corky bark and deep roots make them exceptionally fire- and drought-resistant, surviving Midwest extremes while supporting 500+ insect species and their predators. A single mature bur oak can contribute 200+ pounds of leaves annually, gradually building several inches of rich, fungi-dominated soil over 50–100 years while providing wildlife mast and carbon sequestration.

12. **Swamp White Oak** (*Quercus bicolor*): Tolerates both wet and dry conditions, making it ideal for variable Midwest terrain, while producing sweet acorns favored by wildlife and developing a broad canopy that intercepts and cycles nutrients. Its peeling bark creates habitat for insects and lichens, adding biodiversity layers, and the trees readily establish from acorns cached by squirrels. Over 40–80 years, swamp white oaks build deep forest soils through leaf litter, acorn contribution, and symbiotic relationships with hundreds of species, sequestering 1–2 tons of carbon annually per mature tree.

13. **American Chestnuts** (*Castanea dentata*, blight-resistant hybrids): Once-dominant forest trees now available in blight-resistant forms, producing abundant nuts while building soil through heavy leaf drop and extensive mycorrhizal networks. Their rapid growth (3–5 feet annually when young) allows them to outcompete weeds and begin mast production within 5–8 years, much faster than oaks. Each mature tree produces 50–100 pounds of nuts annually while contributing 100+ pounds of tannin-rich leaves that create acidic, fungal-dominated soils supporting diverse understory communities.

14. **Chinkapin Oak** (*Quercus muehlenbergii*): Smaller oak species producing sweet, fast-ripening acorns annually (unlike the biennial cycle of most oaks), ensuring consistent wildlife food and reliable seedling recruitment. Prefers alkaline soils common in glaciated Midwest regions, filling a niche other oaks avoid, and its moderate size (40–60 feet) makes it suitable for suburban lots. The limestone-loving roots help buffer soil pH while the annual acorn and leaf crop builds alkaline forest soils rich in calcium, supporting diverse wildflower understories.

15. **Shagbark Hickory** (*Carya ovata*): Produces edible nuts with sweet, rich flavor while developing distinctive peeling bark that creates habitat for bats and cavity-nesting birds. The deep taproot and slow growth (taking 30–40 years to begin significant nut production) mean hickories are in it for the long haul, eventually creating dense, nutrient-rich forest soils. Each mature tree drops 100–200 pounds of leaves and husks annually, contributing high-quality organic matter that decomposes slowly to build stable humus layers supporting diverse soil fauna.

16. **Butternut** (*Juglans cinerea*): Fast-growing native walnuts with compound leaves that decompose into nitrogen-rich mulch, though they also produce juglone that selectively suppresses certain plants while allowing compatible species. The oblong nuts are edible and favored by wildlife, and trees begin producing within 5–10 years, providing quicker returns than most nut trees. Butternuts excel at colonizing disturbed sites, with their deep taproots breaking up compacted subsoils and bringing up minerals that enrich surface layers through annual leaf drop of 50–100 pounds per tree.

17. **Black Walnut** (*Juglans nigra*): Valuable timber tree producing edible nuts and juglone-rich leaf litter that creates specialized forest communities adapted to its chemical ecology. The massive taproots dive 10+ feet deep, accessing water during droughts and creating channels for organic matter to penetrate subsoil layers when roots eventually decay. While juglone limits companion planting options, it also suppresses aggressive invasives, and the heavy nuts ensure reliable recruitment while each tree contributes 100–200 pounds of high-carbon leaves annually to build rich, dark soils.

18. **American Hazelnut** (*Corylus americana*): Native shrubs covered under #8 but worth emphasizing for their nitrogen-fixing capabilities, prolific suckering that creates wildlife thickets, and early catkins providing critical spring pollen. The nuts are smaller than European varieties but equally edible, and the plants begin producing within 3–4 years of establishment. A 10-foot hazelnut thicket can fix 20–40 pounds of nitrogen annually while dropping 50+ pounds of leaves, creating the nitrogen-rich conditions that facilitate succession to taller trees.

## Berry-Producing Shrubs and Brambles

19. **Serviceberries** (*Amelanchier* spp.): Multi-stemmed shrubs producing sweet, early berries that ripen in June, feeding migrating birds while the plants tolerate shade and form understory colonies. Their white spring blossoms appear before most trees leaf out, supporting early pollinators, and the fine-textured leaves decompose rapidly to feed soil organisms. Root suckering allows serviceberries to expand gradually, eventually forming 15–20 foot groves that contribute 30–50 pounds of leaf litter annually while creating layered habitat structure.

20. **Red Currants** (*Ribes rubrum*): Hardy shrubs producing tart, vitamin-rich berries on wood 2–3 years old, requiring minimal pruning and thriving in partial shade where many fruits fail. Their fibrous root systems stabilize soil while hosting beneficial fungi, and the plants remain compact (4–5 feet), making them suitable for smaller spaces. Annual pruning waste can be dropped as mulch, and the early summer berries attract birds that deposit seeds from other beneficial plants, creating nucleation points for biodiversity while each plant contributes 5–10 pounds of organic matter yearly.

21. **Black Currants** (*Ribes nigrum*): More shade-tolerant than red currants, producing larger berries with intense flavor and exceptional nutritional value, though some cultivars host white pine blister rust (choose resistant varieties). The shrubs tolerate wet soil and winter temperatures to -40°F, making them bombproof for Zone 4 conditions. Their dense, low structure holds snow and leaf litter, creating protected microhabitats, while each plant produces 10–15 pounds of prunings and leaves annually that decompose into nitrogen-rich humus.

22. **Gooseberries** (*Ribes uva-crispa* and hybrids): Thorny shrubs producing tart berries ideal for jams, with their spiny architecture creating predator-safe nesting sites for ground birds while deterring browsers. Like currants, they thrive in partial shade and require minimal care once established, tolerating neglect and poor soils. The plants form dense, 3–4 foot mounds that trap leaves and create humid microclimates supporting soil organisms, with annual leaf drop and berry waste adding 5–10 pounds of organic matter per plant.

## Mushroom-Producing Species (Saprotrophic Fungi)

93. **Wine Cap Mushrooms** (*Stropharia rugosoannulata*): Wood-chip-loving fungi producing large, burgundy-capped mushrooms with excellent flavor, spreading through wood mulch to decompose cellulose and build soil structure. Initial inoculation with spawn starts colonies that persist for years as long as fresh wood chips are added annually (1–2 inches). Each square meter of colonized wood chips can produce 5–10 pounds of mushrooms annually while simultaneously converting wood into humus-rich soil, making wine caps ideal for mulched paths and orchard alleys.

94. **Oyster Mushrooms** (*Pleurotus ostreatus*): Aggressive saprotrophs growing on logs, stumps, and wood chips, producing shelf-like mushroom clusters with delicious flavor while rapidly decomposing wood into soil. Logs inoculated with spawn (especially poplar, willow, or aspen) can produce for 3–5 years before completely decomposing into rich humus. Each fruiting can yield 1–3 pounds of mushrooms per log while the mycelium breaks down lignin and cellulose, potentially converting 100 pounds of wood into 40–50 pounds of fungally-enriched soil over 4–5 years.

95. **Shiitake Mushrooms** (*Lentinula edodes*): Premium culinary mushrooms growing on hardwood logs (especially oak), requiring initial drilling and inoculation but then fruiting reliably for 5–7 years with minimal care. The logs need shade and occasional soaking during dry periods, but otherwise care for themselves while decomposing into soil. Each log can produce 3–5 pounds of mushrooms total while the mycelium slowly converts wood into fungal-dominated soil, and the resulting humus has exceptional water-holding capacity and microbial diversity.

96. **Lion's Mane** (*Hericium erinaceus*): Medicinal and culinary mushroom forming distinctive white, cascading clusters on hardwood logs and stumps, valued for cognitive health benefits while decomposing wood. Inoculated logs produce for 2–4 years in shaded conditions, and the aggressive mycelium rapidly breaks down wood structure. Each fruiting produces 0.5–2 pounds of mushrooms while the decomposition process enriches soil with bioavailable nutrients and complex fungal metabolites that benefit plant health.

97. **Blewit Mushrooms** (*Clitocybe nuda*): Cold-tolerant mushrooms fruiting in fall and early spring, thriving in compost, leaf litter, and wood chips while breaking down organic matter and creating nutrient-rich soil. The mushrooms appear in rings or clusters, often in the same locations for years once established naturally or through introduction. Each fruiting area can produce 2–5 pounds of mushrooms while the mycelium creates complex soil food webs, and the preference for cool weather means they fruit when few other mushrooms are available.

98. **King Stropharia** (*Stropharia rugosoannulata*, same as wine cap #93): Beyond mushroom production, these fungi form extensive mycelial networks that suppress pathogens, filter water, and improve soil structure through hyphal penetration and exudate production. The mycelium can break down not just wood but also some contaminants, making them useful for bioremediation in addition to food and soil production. Established colonies persist indefinitely with annual wood chip additions, continuously building soil while producing periodic mushroom flushes of 3–10 pounds per 100 square feet.

## Wetland and Rain Garden Species

99. **Joe Pye Weed** (*Eutrochium maculatum*): Tall native perennial (5–7 feet) producing massive pink flower clusters in late summer, tolerating wet soil while attracting butterflies, bees, and beneficial insects. The plants form substantial clumps with extensive root systems that filter water and stabilize soil in rain gardens and pond edges. Each plant contributes 10–15 pounds of coarse stems and leaves annually that decompose to build organic matter, and the height creates vertical structure while the fall seed heads feed birds through winter.

100. **Cardinal Flower** (*Lobelia cardinalis*): Brilliant red native perennial producing spikes of tubular flowers exclusively pollinated by hummingbirds, spreading via stolons in wet soil while tolerating seasonal flooding. The plants prefer moist conditions but establish surprisingly well in regular garden soil if watered during establishment. Each plant contributes 1–2 pounds of foliage annually, and the stoloniferous spread allows them to colonize 10–20 square feet within 5 years while providing critical late-summer nectar for migrating hummingbirds.
