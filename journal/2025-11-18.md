### **Epic 8: "Refactoring" and Next Cycle Planning**

(This final Epic, is about sorting through collected candidate ideas and brainstormed lists of ideas that that emerged for NEXT cycle projects. Prioritize, collate, group iteratively into NEW buckets of ideas for NEXT cyle's Epic of Projects to be planned ... this basically changes from a complete teardown and rebuild into a process of pre-planning and preparation for the NEXT cycle of 7 Epics and 70 Projects. The goal is to get a solid first draft of the NEXT cycle's Epics and Projects, so that when the current cycle of 100 Projects is done, we can hit the ground running with the NEXT cycle of 7 Epics and 70 Projects.)
