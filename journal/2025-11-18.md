### **Epic 8: "Refactoring" and Next Cycle Planning**

(This final epic provides 30 additional "sprints" that synthesize and extend the first 70.)

71.  Revise weights of first 7 Epics [which will drive, in Projects 71-78, the refactoring/revision of all previously planned projects]. The number of Projects in 7 original Epics must shrink from 70 to 50, which will allow for the generation of 3 new Epics and 20 new Projects.  
72.  Refactor / revise Epic 1.  
73.  Refactor / revise Epic 2.   
74.  Refactor / revise Epic 3.   
75.  Refactor / revise Epic 4. 
76.  Refactor / revise Epic 5. 
77.  Refactor / revise Epic 6.   
78.  Refactor / revise Epic 7. 
79.  Brainstorm a list of ideas and then distill that list down to **develop** 20 new Projects ... NEW Project 51 - NEW Project 70  
80. Plan Project NEW Project 51   
81. Plan Project NEW Project 52  
82. Plan Project NEW Project 53
83. Plan Project NEW Project 54  
84. Plan Project NEW Project 55
85. Plan Project NEW Project 56
86. Plan Project NEW Project 57
87. Plan Project NEW Project 58
88. Plan Project NEW Project 59
89. Plan Project NEW Project 60
90. Plan Project NEW Project 61
91. Plan Project NEW Project 62
92. Plan Project NEW Project 63
93. Plan Project NEW Project 64
94. Plan Project NEW Project 65
95. Plan Project NEW Project 66
96. Plan Project NEW Project 67
97. Plan Project NEW Project 68
98. Plan Project NEW Project 69
99. Plan Project NEW Project 70
100. Review, revise, adjust the NEW Epics and NEW ProjectS 1-70, to prepare for the next cycle of 100 Projects ... this will include revising Project 71-78 for the next cycle to reflect the fact that each cycle will involve the distillation of the first 70 Projects into 50, allowing for the revision/refactoring of those *old* 50 and creation of 20 new Projects ... over time, it is expected that the number of projects/cycle might shrink as project graduate to Areas under P.A.R.A. methodology.
