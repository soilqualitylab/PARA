### **BASELINE Epic 8: A 30-Topic "Refactoring" Backlog**

(This final epic provides 30 additional "sprints" that synthesize and extend the first 70\. These are more specific, 'n-of-1' 89 experiments that can be pulled into the "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5) at any time. They directly implement the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11 "refactoring" mindset.)

71. Refactor Sprint: 'Pace Layer' 8 Audit  
    This sprint designs the process for the "mandatory 'Refactoring Sprint'" (Strategy \#3) review of the 6 'Pace Layers'.8 This "annual" (Strategy \#3) 'Agile' 12 review "programs" the 35-year 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) mindset. It asks: "Is the 'Services' 8 layer 'refactoring' (Strategy \#3) as fast as 'Commerce' 113 demands? Is the 'Structure' 8 layer 'remembering' 7 its 'anti-materialist' (user query) goal?"  
72. Refactor Sprint: Biophilic 'Nature Gym' 44 Iteration  
    This sprint is a 'Kaizen' 11 "blitz" 11 to add a new 'biophilic' 40 element (e.g., an outdoor 'HIIT' 78 "stair" 78 or "green turf" 45 area) to the 'Dojo'.37 This will be followed by an 'n-of-1' 89 experiment to test its "stress-reducing" 41 effects on '4x4' 77 "recovery".77 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 as a 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "continuously improving" 47 space.  
73. Refactor Sprint: Potager 'Dojo' 84 Aesthetics  
    This is a 'Kaizen' 11 sprint to refactor one bed of the 'Potager' 83 for purely aesthetic 86 reasons. This involves "painting a picture with plants" 86 using "color palettes" 86 and "textures".84 This "programs" the "artist's" 7 mindset, overriding the 'homesteading' 87 "productivity" 11 mindset, "balancing" 37 'Art' 7 and 'Commerce' 113 (food production).  
74. Refactor Sprint: 5S 'Kaizen Blitz' 11  
    This sprint is a "rapid improvement process" 1111 on a new 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) (e.g., a closet, the 'Larder' 87). This involves fully implementing the '5S' 56 method from scratch.50 This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) of "order" 37 and "discipline" 37 as an active, repeating 'Kaizen' 11 "event".11  
75. N-of-1 Lab 89: Tabata 78 vs. 4x4 77  
    This is a "practical research" (user query) 'n-of-1' 89 experiment sprint. It compares the biometric 9377 and perceived 92 "stress" 41 effects of a 6-week 'Tabata' 78 block vs. a 6-week '4x4' 77 block. This "programs" the "researcher" 89 mindset, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the 'Dojo' 37 training plan 92 based on "data".93  
76. N-of-1 Lab 89: Fermentation 96 and Mood  
    This is an 'n-of-1' 89 sprint to track the correlation between consuming specific fermented foods 9695 from the 'Fermentation Lab' 95 and daily mood 41 and cognitive flow 34 metrics. This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) 'Dojo' 37 lifestyle, "connecting" 2 "nutrition" 89 to "mindset".32  
77. N-of-1 Lab 89: Solitude 38 and Creativity  
    This is an 'n-of-1' 89 sprint to test the 'Sanctuary' 38 design. This involves tracking "creative flow" 3434 on days with and without a programmed "hour of solitude" 38 in the 'Sanctuary' 38 space. This "programs" the discipline of 'solitude' 38, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the daily schedule based on "data" 93 proving its "creative" 34 value.  
78. Neuro-Programming 32: Light Hacking 32  
    This sprint "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the 'Services' 8 layer by researching and implementing a "circadian lighting system".40 This system "programs" the user's 'biorhythms' 40 by "follow\[ing\] the body's natural rhythm" 40 ("blue-white tones" 40 by day, "amber tones" 40 by night). This 'Neuroarchitecture' 32 "hack" enhances "focus" 32 and "productivity" 40 "by day" 40 and "sleep by night".40  
79. Neuro-Programming 32: Soundscape Design 72  
    This sprint "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the 'Studio' 71 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) by designing a 'biophilic' soundscape.106 This 'Neuroarchitecture' 32 sprint involves "introducing sounds from the natural world" 72106 to mask "unwanted noise" 73 and "enhance... focus".32 This "programs" the 'Studio' 71 as a "calm" 41 'Sanctuary'.38  
80. Symbiotic System 10: Water Recycling 15  
    This is a 'Bio-Mimetic' 19 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Services' 8 layer by implementing a greywater or "living machine" 15 water recycling system. This 'Kaizen' 11 "refactor" improves the 'symbiosis' 10 of the 'House as Organism' 15 by "recycl\[ing\] all materials".19 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) "ethos" 28 of "resource efficiency".19  
81. Symbiotic System 10: Soil Food Web 23  
    This is a 'Potager' 83 sprint to research the "Soil Food Web".23 This 'Kaizen' 11 task involves "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the 'Site' 8 layer by starting a "no-till" 60 "composting" 23 system. This "programs" the "permaculture" 81 mindset of "stewardship" 28 by "nurturing the soil" 23 and "programming" the health 81 of the 'Potager Dojo' 84 itself.  
82. Symbiotic System 10: Designing for Pollinators 26  
    This is a 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Potager' 86 and 'Site' 8 by designing for "pollinators".26 This "enhances biodiversity" 10 and "rewards cooperation" 19 (Strategy \#1). This "programs" the mindset to see the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 as a node in a larger "ecosystem" 9, fulfilling the 'Earth Care' 23 ethic.  
83. Dojo 37: 'Kata' 4 Creation  
    This is an 'Embodied Cognition' 2 sprint to create a new, personal 'kata'.4 This "kata" will be a "sequence of... meaningful movement" 2 that traverses the entire 'Dojo-Potager-Studio' 36 'microservice' 52 loop. This "programs" the mind-body-home connection 2 at the deepest 'Embodied' 29 level, "blurring boundaries" 27 between 'self' 30 and 'space'.30  
84. Dojo 37: Weapon (Bokken/Jo) Kata  
    This is a 'Dojo' 37 sprint to research traditional weapon 'kata'.4 This connects the user to the "martial arts mindset" (user query) and "heritage".37 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 with "authenticity" 37, and the "wooden weapons racks" 37 themselves become part of the '5S' 56 "Set in Order" 55 'Dojo' 46 design.  
85. Kaizen 11: The '5 Whys' 58  
    This is a 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint to practice the '5 Whys' 58 'root cause analysis' 58 tool. The next time a "maintenance" (user query) issue arises 59, this sprint involves asking "why" five times to find the systemic root cause. This "programs" the "researcher" 89 mindset, "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the system (e.g., "the '5S' 56 'Shine' 50 process... is inadequate") instead of the symptom.  
86. Kaizen 11: 'Value Stream Mapping' 58  
    This sprint is to research 'Value Stream Mapping'.58 This 'Kaizen' 11 "analytical technique" 11 involves "creating a visual representation" 58 of a single 'homesteading' 87 process.87 This map is then used to "identify and eliminate waste".11 This "programs" the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "efficiency" 11 mindset.  
87. Service 102: 'Asset Mapping' 102  
    This is a 'Sanctuary-Service' 102 sprint to perform the "asset mapping" 102 research. This involves identifying other "community... assets" 102102 that support recovery. This "programs" the 'Sponsorship' 105 mission as an outward-facing 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "collaboration" 12, "build\[ing\] stronger connections" 102 and "foster\[ing\] mutually beneficial relationships".102  
88. Service 104: Hosting a 'Peer Support' 103 Meeting  
    This is a "capstone" 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) "release" for the 'Service' 102 epic. This involves designing and hosting a "peer support group" 103 in the 'Sanctuary-Service' 38 space. This tests the "dual-mode" 38 design (Epic 7, Topic 66\) in a "real-world" scenario, "programming" the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 as a true "community asset".102  
89. Studio 35: 'Biophilic Art' 42  
    This is an 'Artist's Studio' 36 sprint to research "indirect biophilia" 42 and "natural analogues".7272 This involves creating a piece of "sculpture" (user query) or "art" 35 that is inspired by the "biomimetic" 9 forms found in the 'Potager' 83 or 'Site'.8 This "programs" the "artist's" 7 mindset, "connecting haptic experiences and memories" 2 to the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9).  
90. Studio 71: Music and Nature 72  
    This is a 'Music' (user query) sprint to compose a piece of music in the 'Biophilic Acoustic' 71 studio. This composition will use "soundscape" 106 "acoustic recording\[s\]" 106 from the 'Symbiotic' 10 landscape. This "programs" the "artist's" 7 "creative flow" 34 by "blurring boundaries" 27 between the 'Artist' 7 'Pace Layer' 7 and the 'Nature' 7 'Pace Layer'.7  
91. Refactor Sprint: 'Anti-Materialist' (User Query) 'Sort' 55  
    This is an "annual" (Strategy \#3) 'Kaizen' 11 sprint to re-perform the '5S' 55 Seiri 55 step for the entire home. This "refactor" (Strategy \#3) is purely 'anti-materialist' (user query) and 'philosophical'.24 Its purpose is to "eliminate unnecessary items" 55 and "curb excesses from within".19 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, actively "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) the "conventional affluent" (user query) "Stuff" 8 layer.  
92. Refactor Sprint: 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) Update  
    This is a 'DevOps' 12 sprint to "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) itself. This involves updating the 3D model, the 'IaC' 63 scripts, and the 'n-of-1' 89 "data" 93 logs. This "programs" the "Kaizen" 11 mindset of 'Seiso' 50, ensuring the simulation (Strategy \#2) remains a 1-to-1, "reliable" 63 copy of the physical 'Symbiotic Home'.10  
93. N-of-1 Lab 89: 'Pneumo-visual' 30 Interaction  
    This is an advanced 'Neuro-Programming' 32 sprint. It involves researching "multisensory body-related inputs" 30 like "pneumo-visual" 30 (breath-to-sight) feedback. This "n-of-1" 89 "tinkering" (user query) experiment will "refactor" (Strategy \#3) the 'Sanctuary' 38 with 'bio-feedback' 93 sensors and 'circadian' 40 lighting. This "programs" a deeper 'Contemplative' 39 state by "alter\[ing\]... self-location" 30 ("programming the mindset").  
94. N-of-1 Lab 89: 'Cardio-visual' 30 Interaction  
    This is a sister sprint to \#93, for the 'Dojo'.37 This 'n-of-1' 89 "tinkering" (user query) experiment will 'refactor' (Strategy \#3) the 'Dojo' 37 with "cardio-visual" 30 (heartbeat-to-sight) feedback. This tests 93 if visualizing the 85-95% max heart rate 77 biophilically 40 (e.g., as a pulsing "living" 15 light-form) improves '4x4' 77 training adherence and "programs" a "mindful body".2  
95. Kaizen 11: 'Shitsuke' (Sustain) 50  
    This is a purely philosophical 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint on the 5th 'S': Shitsuke.50 This is the "martial arts mindset" (user query) applied to 'Kaizen'.11 It's about researching how to "make the improvements a permanent part of the... culture" 58 and "internalise each step".50 This "programs" the end-goal of the 10,000-day project: to make the 'Dojo' 37 lifestyle "effortless" 34, not "laborious".50  
96. Pace Layering 7: The 'Culture' 8 Layer  
    This is a 35-year "slow" 7 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) sprint. This involves researching the 'Culture' 8 layer of the 'Pace Layer' 7 model. This "refactors" (Strategy \#3) the user's "anti-materialist" (user query) identity by "connecting... memories" 2 and "ancestors" 24 to the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Potager' 85 practices. This "programs" the cultural 113 "why" (Strategy \#9) of the 10,000-day project.  
97. Pace Layering 7: The 'Nature' 8 Layer  
    This is the slowest 7 'Lighthouse' (Strategy \#9) sprint. This is the 'Site' 8 layer. This 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 sprint involves researching the 'geological' 8 and deep time 107 history of the 'Site' 8 itself. This "programs" the "Dojo" 37 mindset to align with the 'Nature' 7 layer, the "slow \[layer that\] has all the power".7  
98. Refactor Sprint: 'Epoch 1' (Strategy \#8) Review  
    This is a 7-year 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) sprint. This is the "Great Refactor" (Strategy \#8) planned in sprint \#19. It involves a full 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 review of the "Tech Stack" (Strategy \#8) and 'Permaculture' 22 systems. This sprint "programs" the long-term 'Kaizen' 11 by using the 'Digital Twin' (Strategy \#2) to plan the "refactor" (Strategy \#3) of the next 7-year 'Epoch' (Strategy \#8).  
99. The 'Lighthouse' 107 Itself  
    This is a philosophical 'meta' 107 sprint. This involves reading Stewart Brand's The Clock of the Long Now 68 and other 'Long Now' 7 foundation texts. This research "programs" the mindset for the "10,000-day" (35-year) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9). This "reframes" the "anti-materialist" (user query) 'Dojo' 37 'Kaizen' 11 project as a vital "responsibility" 107 in a "networked world where everything seems to be about speed".107  
100. The 'Dynamic Backlog' (Strategy \#5) Itself  
     This is the final 'meta' sprint. This involves refactoring the backlog (this very list). This 'Agile' 12 "self-organize" 19 task uses the 'AI-Curated' (Strategy \#5) 'Dynamic Backlog' (Strategy \#5) to "add/delete tasks" (Strategy \#5) from this list, based on the results 12 of the first 'n-of-1' 89 sprints. This sprint closes the loop, turning the 10,000-day 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 "refactoring" (Strategy \#3) process back onto itself, achieving a true "continuous evolution" 12 "symbiotic" 10 system.
