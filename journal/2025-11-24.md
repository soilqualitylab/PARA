Maximizing value per unit, depends upon constantly upgraded, simplified specs ... it also depends on soil building, in order to enable the future ability to maximize value and that demands a LIVING soil with an ecosystem of soil building organisms that will will continue converting organic material to soil organic material.

It's impossible to overstate the value of a great LIVING soil on any piece of ground next to a dwelling; if you had to purchase 1/2 cubic foot of garden soil, you would spend at least $10/cubic foot for great soil or $50,000 to cover 10,000 square ft with just 6" of soil but that's ONLY a start. A covering of soil would still be grossly insufficent compared to in situ development of the living ecosytems necessary to support future soil building ... it's not just the soil, it's the LIVING ecoystems supporting FUTURE soil building.

There are many examples of what kinds of things you can do on bare, suburban fill ... but mostly it requires PATIENCE.  

An example illustrates this: henbit (*Lamium amplexicaule*) is a self-naturalizing plant that should be seen as a pioneer species for disturbed, junk-filled soil in the upper Midwest. Building soil is about being extremely patient, but it's about STARTING and then patiently waiting. That means STARTING practically, keeping the process extremely simple and unmechanized, while observing the progress and adapting based on frequent walks (noting coverage, weed incursions, observing SOM, not with ineffective test kits that test DEAD carbon, but by observing worms, fungi and living soil ecosystems).

The following strategies form a flexible blueprint to build soil relative to certain constaints: zero-maintenance, erosion control, SOM improvement, and leaf-holding without noisy, costly mechanized upkeep. 

Each strategy spans 3–4 decades, treating henbit as a "scaffold" species—dominant early on (years 1–10) for stabilization, then phased into understory or companion roles (years 11–20) as soil improves, and finally a legacy element (years 21–40) in a mature ecosystem. Strategies emphasize passive succession, minimal intervention, and monitoring via simple soil tests (e.g., annual SOM probes) to track progress.

1. **Passive Erosion Blanket with Zonal Seeding**: Establish henbit as a primary cover by broadcasting seeds (or allowing natural recruitment) across your entire site in fall, targeting 80–90% coverage within year 1. Divide the area into erosion-prone zones (e.g., slopes vs. flats). In years 1–10, let it mat-form to bind "junk fill" particles, reducing runoff by up to 70% via its fibrous roots. By years 11–20, overseed zones with mid-succession perennials like red clover (Trifolium pratense) in low-erosion flats, using henbit's shade tolerance to nurse them. In years 21–40, henbit persists as a spring understory, holding leaf litter while deeper-rooted natives (e.g., prairie dropseed) take over slopes, yielding a 20–30% SOM gain overall.

2. **Winter Biomass Accumulator with Mulch Mimicry**: Encourage henbit's dense spring growth to trap and decompose fall leaves naturally, mimicking mulch without raking. In years 1–5, mow once post-flowering (late May) at 4–6 inches to return clippings as green manure, boosting microbial activity. Over years 6–15, reduce mowing to every other year, allowing self-seeding to thicken mats that cycle nutrients (nitrogen fixation via associated microbes). By years 16–40, integrate woody debris piles in corners; henbit colonizes edges, accelerating decomposition and fostering mycorrhizal networks for a 1–2% annual SOM increment in the top 6 inches.

3. **Pollinator Corridor Builder**: Leverage henbit's early nectar (peaking March–April) to create linear "corridors" along site edges, sowing seeds densely in 2–3 ft wide strips. Years 1–10: It draws bees and hoverflies, suppressing pest insects in bare soil. Years 11–20: Extend corridors inward by 10 ft/decade, interplanting with bee balm (Monarda fistulosa) as soil pH stabilizes (henbit tolerates 5.5–7.5). Years 21–40: Corridors evolve into full hedgerows with shrubs like elderberry, where henbit underpins biodiversity, indirectly enhancing soil via pollinator-mediated seed dispersal of nitrogen-fixers, targeting 15–25% greater invertebrate-driven SOM buildup.

4. **No-Till Layering for Gradual Stratification**: Treat the site as a no-till "lasagna" bed, starting with henbit as the base layer. Years 1–8: Allow natural die-back to form thatch, then lightly scarify (rake) annually to incorporate biomass without tilling, preventing compaction in clay-heavy junk fill. Years 9–20: Add annual wood chip toppings (1–2 inches/year from local sources) over henbit mats to suppress excess seeding while enriching fungal activity. Years 21–40: Henbit thins naturally as deeper strata form; test for 4–6% SOM, then spot-introduce trees like serviceberry, using henbit as a nurse plant to retain moisture and reduce transplant shock.

5. **pH Buffer and Nutrient Scavenger Zones**: Map soil variability (e.g., acidic clay pockets vs. alkaline sand) and prioritize henbit in low-pH zones where it excels (tolerating down to 5.0). Years 1–10: Its scavenging roots uptake excess aluminum/manganese, slowly neutralizing via organic acid exudates. Years 11–25: Monitor pH quarterly; in buffered areas, underplant with lime-loving species like yarrow (Achillea millefolium) to diversify scavenging. Years 26–40: Henbit becomes a legacy indicator—sparse in improved zones, dense in persistent hot spots—facilitating a balanced 6.0–7.0 pH profile and 10–15% SOM uplift through sustained nutrient cycling.

6. **Microclimate Modifier for Succession Phasing**: Use henbit's low mat (6–16 inches) to create shaded micro-nurseries in sun-exposed junk fill. Years 1–12: Its foliage cools soil by 2–5°F in summer, retaining moisture for germination of opportunistic seeds. Years 13–25: As mats thicken, selectively thin 20% annually to allow light for brassicas like mustard as companions, building a green manure sequence. Years 26–40: Henbit moderates extremes in a maturing woodland edge, supporting oak understory; this passive cooling could double seedling survival rates, compounding to 25–35% SOM via layered litter inputs.

7. **Seed Bank Manager with Rotational Disturbance**: Maintain a dynamic seed bank by disturbing 10–20% of the site yearly (e.g., light forking in fall) to reset henbit dominance without full tillage. Years 1–10: This ensures 100% coverage renewal, locking in erosion control. Years 11–20: Rotate disturbances to favor henbit-retreat areas for buckwheat or rye covers, harvesting henbit biomass for compost. Years 21–40: Reduce to 5% disturbance; henbit's long-viable seeds (10+ years) provide resilience against setbacks like drought, sustaining a diverse bank that boosts SOM resilience by 1% per decade through adaptive recolonization.

8. **Carbon Sequestration Tracker with Baseline Metrics**: Baseline your site's carbon (via free soil cores tested annually for SOM). Use henbit's rapid turnover (2000+ seeds/plant, shallow roots adding 0.5 tons C/acre/year) as a measurable sink. Years 1–15: Track gains from its biomass (aim for 5–10 tons dry matter/acre over winter), avoiding inputs to maximize sequestration. Years 16–30: Pair with deep-rooted companions like daikon radish in quadrants, using henbit as a surface stabilizer. Years 31–40: Henbit contributes to a "legacy carbon" pool in stable soils, potentially sequestering 20–40 tons C/acre total, verifiable against Midwest baselines for disturbed sites.

9. **Biodiversity Scaffold with Faunal Integration**: Introduce low-effort faunal elements (e.g., bird feeders for seed dispersal) to amplify henbit's role. Years 1–10: Its flowers attract ground-nesting bees, whose tunneling aerates soil. Years 11–20: As SOM rises, add brush piles; henbit holds litter, drawing earthworms (target 50–100/m²). Years 21–40: Evolve to a food forest fringe where henbit nurses fungi and invertebrates, fostering 2–3x greater macrofauna diversity and accelerating SOM via bioturbation—potentially 30% higher than henbit-only plots.

10. **Resilience Buffer Against Climate Variability**: Capitalize on henbit's drought tolerance once established (prefers moist but adapts to variable Midwest weather). Years 1–10: It stabilizes bare soil during wet springs/floods. Years 11–25: In warming trends, its early senescence frees niches for heat-tolerant successors like little bluestem. Years 26–40: Henbit acts as a "climate sentinel"—monitoring via coverage density for adjustments (e.g., irrigate seed zones in dry years)—ensuring 3–4 decades of incremental improvement, with SOM plateaus at 3–5% supporting self-sustaining natives and buffering extremes like 20–30% rainfall swings projected for the upper Midwest.
