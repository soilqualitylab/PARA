### **Epic 7: The Sanctuary & Service (The 'Spiritual' & 'Sponsorship' Life)**

*(This epic implements the "spiritual matters and solitude" and "sponsorship" goals. It focuses on designing for two "non-materialist" modes: deep solitude and active peer support.)*

61. The Architecture of Solitude 38  
    This sprint researches architects like Luis Barragán, who championed "solitude as good company".38 This research "goes against the grain" 38 of modern design that "shuns" 38 "intimate communion with solitude".38 The goal is to design "spaces of solitude" 38 that "slow... down" 38 and create "meditative emptiness" 38, using the home as a "psychological canvas".75 This "programs" the "spiritual matters" (user query) goal.  
62. The 'Contemplative Designer' Framework 39  
    This sprint studies the "Contemplative Designer" framework 39 to learn how to "intentionally create spaces of deeper connection".39 This research provides the method for designing 'Sanctuary' 38 spaces that "induce dramatic changes in... brain patterns" 39 similar to "long term contemplative practitioners".39 This "programs" the designer 39 mindset, "cultivat\[ing\] 'internal' technologies" 39 of "empathy" 39 and "wonder".39  
63. Designing the 'Urban Monastery' 101  
    This sprint analyzes "urban monastery" 101 designs as a 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 case study. This research focuses on using materials 101 and "fine and fragile" 101 details to "blur... scales" 101 and "encourage a state of contemplation".101 This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) aesthetic, "balancing tradition" 37 with a "monastic" 101 focus on "solitude and reflection".101  
64. Designing for Peer Support 102  
    This is the "Service" (user query) sprint. It involves researching the spatial needs of "peer support services" 104 and "support groups".103 This is not "clinical" 104 design. It is about "designing... peer recovery support" 102 spaces that are safe, non-hierarchical, "community asset\[s\]" 102, and "foster... mutually beneficial relationships".102 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 as a "community space".46  
65. The Architecture of 'Sponsorship' 104  
    This sprint focuses on the "sponsorship" (user query) goal, which is "foundational" 105 to recovery. This requires a space that supports a '1-on-1' "shared lived experience".105104 The design must foster trust and vulnerability, drawing on the "safe harbor" 102 principles of recovery spaces. This "programs" the service (user query) aspect of the "anti-materialist" (user query) 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9).  
66. Dual-Mode Space: The 'Sanctuary-Service' Synthesis 38  
    This is the key design challenge of this epic. It's about designing a 'Modular Zone' (Strategy \#7) that can be both a 'Sanctuary' for "intimate communion with solitude" 38 and a 'Service' space for "peer support groups".103 The design must be functionally modular, transforming 8 from one to the other without compromising the "psychological safety" 75 of either mode. This "programs" the flexibility 11 of the 'Dojo'.37  
67. 'Asset-Based Community Development' 102  
    This sprint researches the "asset-based community development" 102 theory. This is the philosophy for the "service" goal. The 'Symbiotic Home' 10 itself will be "mapped" as a "natural asset" 102 for the "recovery community".102 This "programs" the 'sponsorship' 105 goal, "foster\[ing\] mutually beneficial relationships" 102 and fulfilling the 'Permaculture' 23 'Fair Share' 23 ethic.  
68. Responsible Finance \[User Query\]  
    This is a practical 'Governance' 113 layer sprint on "responsible finance" (user query). This involves researching "anti-materialist" (user query) financial models (e.g., 'Financial Independence', 'Minimalism', 'Bogleheads') to ensure the 35-year, "high upfront cost" 13 'Utilidor' 13 project is financially sustainable. This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset into the funding 113 of the 'Symbiotic Home'.10  
69. Correspondence and Legal \[User Query\]  
    This is a 'Kaizen' 11 sprint on "correspondence" and "legal paperwork" (user query). This involves designing a '5S' 56 "office" space and a process 50 for handling these 'Governance' 113 layer tasks. This "programs" efficiency 11 into the "boring" 59 tasks, "eliminating waste" 11 so they don't disrupt the 'Flow' 34 of the 'Artist' 7 layer.  
70. Resurrection and Accountability \[User Query\]  
    This is the final, philosophical "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) sprint. This is about researching the meaning of "resurrection" and "accountability" (user query) as actions 102, not just "worship activities" (user query). This research will form the ethos of the 'Service' 104 mission. This "programs" the purpose 47 of the 10,000-day 'Dojo' 37 project.
