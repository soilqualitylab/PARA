### **Epic 6: The Lab & Larder (The 'N-of-1' Research & 'Homesteading' Practice)**

*(This epic focuses on the user's "practical research" goals. It creates spaces for "n-of-1" experiments, "tinkering," and "food preservation," merging the "lab" and the "workshop.")*

51. 'N-of-1' Trial Methodology 89  
    This sprint researches the "n-of-1" 89 or "do-it-yourself" 91 clinical trial methodology. This "single-patient" 89 approach is the scientific method for the 35-year project, providing a "controlled trial" 89 framework for "personalized nutrition research".89 This "programs" the "researcher" (user query) mindset, rejecting "conventional 'one-size-fits-all' approach\[es\]".89  
52. Designing the Home 'N-of-1' Lab 92  
    This sprint is about designing the space for "n-of-1" experiments.89 This "lab" 93 will be designed to support "home-based exercise programme\[s\]" 92 and the tracking of "biometric data".9393 This "programs" the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Kitchen' 95 as "labs" 93 to "optimize... workouts, and diet".93  
53. The 5S Kaizen Workshop 56  
    This is the 'Tinkering' and 'Maintenance' (user query) sprint. It involves applying the '5S' 'Kaizen' 56 methodology to the workshop.56 The goal is "A place for everything, and everything in its place".56 This "programs" the "tinkering" (user query) mindset, creating an "organized and productive" 56 space where "tools" 57 are accessible, "less time" 57 is wasted, and "maintenance" 94 is "effortless".50  
54. Designing the Fermentation Lab 95  
    This sprint researches the spatial requirements for a "fermentation kitchen".95 This "food preservation" 87 lab 96 involves "regulation of temperatures" 95, "large sink" 95 prep areas, and "cave" 95 or "root cellar" storage. This "programs" the "homesteading" 87 lifestyle by creating a "lab" 96 for "nurturing conditions" 96 for "beneficial microorganisms".9695  
55. Fermentation Science: Lactic Acid 96  
    This sprint researches the science of "lactic acid" 96 fermentation for "sauerkraut and kimchi".96 This is the 'n-of-1' 89 "practical research" (user query) for "personalized nutrition".89 This "programs" the "scientist" mindset, "managing microbes" 96 to "improve... absorb\[tion\] of... nutrients" 96 and "gut-health".96  
56. Food Preservation: Canning 98  
    This sprint researches the "canning process" 98, which "involves placing foods in jars... and heating them to a temperature that destroys microorganisms".98 This sprint also includes the safety and legal requirements 99 (e.g., "test\[ing\] it at an approved commercial laboratory" for "pH of 4.6 or lower," 99). This "programs" the "homesteading" 87 "self-sufficiency" 87 lifestyle, ensuring the "food preservation lab" 95 is safe and "effective".90  
57. The Workshop as 'Root Cause Analysis' Hub 58  
    This sprint links the 'Kaizen' 58 philosophy to the 'Tinkering' workshop.56 The workshop will be the "lab" 93 for 'Root Cause Analysis' 5858 for any "failure" in the 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 home. When something breaks, the process is to "tinker" (user query) until the root cause is found and "refactored".12 This "programs" a mindset of solving problems 58, not just fixing symptoms.  
58. The 'Larder' as a Data Source 87  
    The "food preservation" 87 "larder" (pantry) will be designed as part of the 'N-of-1' Lab.89 This 'Kaizen-DevOps' 12 sprint involves designing a "pantry" that is also an inventory system.55 This provides "data" 93 for the user's "self-sufficiency" 87 metrics 11 and "n-of-1" nutritional experiments.89 This "programs" the 'Homesteading' 88 lifestyle as a 'Data-Driven' 93 practice.  
59. Tools and Maintenance as Kaizen 11  
    This is a philosophical sprint about reframing "tinkering, tools, maintenance" (user query). These are not "chores".50 They are the core of the 'Kaizen' 11 "continuous improvement" 47 process. The '5S Workshop' 56 is the "Dojo" 37 for this practice. This "programs" the "martial arts mindset" (user query) of discipline and respect for one's "tools" 57 and "environment".56  
60. N-of-1 vs. 'One-Size-Fits-All' 89  
    This is a foundational "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research sprint into the philosophy of "personalized nutrition".89 This rejects the "conventional 'one-size-fits-all' approach" 89 that defines the "affluent materialist" (user query) lifestyle. This research "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, fully embracing the 'N-of-1' 89 "experimental" 93 "Dojo" 37 lifestyle.
