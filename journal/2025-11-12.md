# Lifestyle self-programming through daily tasks improving built/landscaped environment

This journal entry outlines a 10,000-day (35-year) operational framework for a project that transcends conventional construction. The objective is not to build a static object—a "home" in the materialist sense—but to initiate and sustain a 35-year process of co-creation. This process will cultivate a built environment that functions as a "Dojo": a space of discipline, practice, and transformation. The environment's primary function is to "program" its inhabitant, actively fostering a non-materialist, creative, productive, and service-oriented life.

The project rejects the "conventional affluent materialist lifestyle" in its entirety. It substitutes the accumulation of objects with the cultivation of discipline; passive consumption with active creation; and isolation with intentional service. The philosophical touchstones are the austerity and focus of a martial arts dojo, the self-sufficiency of a homestead, the mindful presence of a permaculture garden, the empirical rigor of a laboratory, and the creative energy of an artist's studio.

### **1.1. Defining the 'Lighthouse': The Home as a 'Dojo' for the Mind**

The 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9) provides the 35-year "why" for the project. This vision is a fixed, guiding principle: **to create a symbiotic, self-refactoring environment that programs a state of "Disciplined Creative Flow."**

This "Lighthouse" guides all 10,000 daily tasks. The home is reconceptualized as a *Dojo* (a "place of the way").1 A traditional dojo's design is not arbitrary; it is an active participant in the training. Its minimalism, order, and cleanliness 37 are intended to "train the mind" 37 and foster respect and focus. In this project, the entire property—house, landscape, studio, and workshop—is conceived as this "place of the way."

The environment will be designed to "program" this mindset through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Embodied Cognition:** The architecture will be designed to shape movement, posture, and action.2 By requiring mindful interaction, the space *becomes* the 'kata' (practice form), transforming the 10,000 daily tasks of maintenance and living into a continuous martial arts practice.3  
2. **Neuroarchitecture:** The environment will be engineered to induce specific, desirable cognitive and emotional states.5 Spaces will be calibrated to foster the "flow state" 34 required for creative work (music, art, sculpture), the "parasympathetic" (rest and digest) state 43 for recovery and contemplation, and the "focused" 32 state for high-intensity training and technical work.

The 35-year project is, therefore, the *practice*. The 10,000 "atomic daily tasks" are the 'kata'. The built environment is the 'Dojo'. The "Lighthouse Vision" is the unwavering goal of 'Disciplined Creative Flow'.

### **1.2. The 10-Strategy Operational Framework**

The "how" for achieving this 35-year vision is defined by the 10-point project planning strategy. These 10 strategies are not a simple list; they form a sophisticated, integrated "Strategy Stack" that operates at different scales and speeds, much like Stewart Brand's 'Pace Layering' model.7

This stack ranges from the project's core philosophy (the 'Operating System') and its physical-temporal architecture (the 'Chassis') to its daily process management (the 'Software') and its long-term controls (the 'Dashboard').

The 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' (Symbiotic) Strategy is the foundational *Operating System*—the core philosophy that dictates the entire system's relationship with its environment.9 The 15% 'Kaizen-DevOps' and 12% 'Agile' strategies are the *Process Management* tools that execute the 10,000-day project.11 The 10% 'Foundational Platform' (Utilidor) and 9% 'Pace Layering' strategies define the *Physical and Temporal Architecture*, creating a resilient "chassis" built for 35 years of change.8 The remaining strategies ('Dynamic Backlog', 'Modular Zone', 'Epoch', 'Lighthouse', 'Digital Twin') are the *Tools and Controls* used to navigate, manage, and refactor the project over its lifespan.

The following table serves as the project's single-page manifesto, mapping all 10 strategies to their function, core concept, and the primary "Epic" (or research category) they will generate in the 100-topic "Dynamic Backlog."

## **Part 2: The Symbiotic Home: The Bio-Mimetic (40%) Operating System**

The dominant (40%) strategy, 'Bio-Mimetic' (Symbiotic), defines the project's core philosophy and operating system. It dictates that the built environment will not be a "machine for living in" 14, but a "living organism" 15 to be cultivated. This section defines this paradigm, moving beyond simple mimicry to true symbiosis.

### **2.1. Biomimicry vs. Biomorphism vs. Symbiosis**

It is essential to clarify the terminology that defines this 40% strategy. The project rejects 'Biomorphism', which is the "use of formal and geometric elements found in nature... for aesthetic properties" 9 but which may lack a deeper function.

The project *begins* with 'Biomimicry', which is the "study and application of construction principles which are found in natural environments... into the design of sustainable solutions".9 This involves learning from nature's *processes* and *principles*.9 A classic example is the Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe, which mimics the passive ventilation and thermal mass strategies of a termite mound 14 to maintain a stable temperature without traditional air conditioning. This project will learn from such "Life's Principles": "Nature runs on sunlight," "Nature recycles everything," "Nature rewards cooperation".19

However, the strategy's "Symbiotic" qualifier pushes this concept to a more profound level. It is not enough to *mimic* an ecosystem; the goal is to *become* one. 'Symbiotic architecture' is a "holistic design approach that fosters mutually beneficial relationships between buildings and their surrounding environments".10 The architecture is reframed as a "living participant in complex, interdependent systems".10

This "House as Organism" 15 is not a metaphor; it is an engineering brief. The house will be designed with a "metabolism" (e.g., using "photosynthesis of plants and algae to convert light energy into electricity") 15 and "lungs" (e.g., a "vegetation system that converts carbon dioxide into oxygen" or a passive "ventilation system that breathes").15 The home's "skin" will be an "adaptive architectural envelope" 20 that responds to climate, and its "metabolism" will "participate in regenerative processes" 10, such as enhancing local biodiversity.

### **2.2. Permaculture as Architecture: The Integrated System**

The primary *practical application* of the 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' (Symbiotic) strategy is permaculture. For this project, "permaculture" 21 and "architecture" are not two separate disciplines; they are a single, integrated design system.22

Permaculture provides the operational "design philosophy" 23 for creating "sustainable human environments based on... ecological, environmental, and resilience design principles".21 It is the "art of making connections between humans and the land".24 The core ethics—"Earth Care, People Care, Fair Share" 23—provide the moral and philosophical grounding for the project's anti-materialist, service-oriented goals.

In this framework, the permaculture "Zone 0" (the house itself) 25 and the "Zone 1" (the potager/kitchen garden) are designed as one contiguous "agriculture ecosystem".26 The house will be designed to "blur boundaries between the inside and out".27 The 10,000 "atomic daily tasks" of the 35-year project are, in effect, the daily practice of "stewardship and co-creation" 28 required to maintain this symbiotic system.22 The permaculture garden is not just a food source; it is the *engine* of the home's "metabolism" 15 and the "living dojo" for its inhabitant.

## **Part 3: Programming the Mind: Neuroarchitecture and the Embodied Dojo**

This section explains the *mechanism* of the project's primary goal: how the environment will "program the mindset." The "Dojo" is not just a room for training; it is the *entire property*, and its programming power comes from the scientific fields of embodied cognition and neuroarchitecture.

### **3.1. Embodied Cognition: The Body as the Seat of Mind**

The project is founded on the principles of Embodied Cognition, a field that posits that "the body or the body's interactions with the environment constitute or contribute to cognition".29 The mind is not a "brain in a vat"; it is a "mindful body".2 The environment, therefore, becomes a critical part of the cognitive process itself.30

This project will leverage this mechanism. The architecture will be designed to *shape movement* and *disrupt habit*. By creating architectural elements that "disrupt habitual movements" 3, such as a staircase with non-standard risers (like those of Carlo Scarpa) 3 or a doorway that requires a specific orientation 2, the environment "activates attentional switches".3 This disruption forces the inhabitant out of "mind-wandering" 31 and into a state of *mindful presence*.

This is the "House as Kata." A 'kata' (practice form) in martial arts is a sequence of "meaningful movement" 2 designed to program the body and mind.4 In this project, the 10,000-day "atomic tasks" *are* the kata. The daily act of "maintenance," "gardening," or "tinkering" becomes a "mindful body approach" 2 that "connects body's movements with emotions and memories".2 The architecture is the partner in this dance, and the house *is* the dojo.

### **3.2. Neuroarchitecture: Designing for Focus, Flow, and Solitude**

Neuroarchitecture provides the technical, evidence-based tools for this "programming." It is the study of "how built environments impact the nervous system, emotions, and human behavior".5 The design will use form, light, sound, and spatial flow 32 to intentionally induce the desired mental states.

* **For Creative Flow (The Studio):** The project requires spaces for "music, art, sculpture" (user query). Neuroimaging studies of "flow state" 34 show it involves a "release of control" of the brain's "executive control network".34 The "artist's studio" will be designed to facilitate this: "open, high-ceilinged spaces" 32 will be used to "encourage expansive thinking and innovation".32 Specific art, colors 35, and sensory stimuli 33 will be curated to create an "immersive, joyful creative state".36  
* **For Focus (The Dojo):** In contrast, "more enclosed, intimate spaces can foster concentration and reflection".32 This principle will be used to design the "Dojo" training space. The design will be minimal, orderly, and clean 37, creating an environment for "reflection" 76 and the precise, "focused" 32 practice of 'kata'.4  
* **For Solitude (The Sanctuary):** A key "anti-materialist" goal is "spiritual matters and solitude" (user query). Modern design often "shuns" solitude.38 This project will "go against the grain" 38 by creating spaces explicitly for "intimate communion with solitude".38 Drawing on architects like Luis Barragán, who praised solitude as "good company" 38, these spaces will be designed for "contemplation" 100 and "meditative emptiness".38 This is the "Contemplative Designer" framework in action.39  
* **For Recovery (The Parasympathetic):** The environment will be designed to *balance* the nervous system. Today's "fast-paced lifestyle" 43 over-activates the "sympathetic" (fight or flight) nervous system. The architecture will be "restorative" 43, using biophilic design 40 and natural materials 42 to "amplify the rest and digest mode" (the parasympathetic state) 43, which is essential for recovery from high-intensity training and creative work.

### **3.3. The Biophilic Dojo: Synthesizing Austerity and Nature**

This project synthesizes the "dojo lifestyle" 37 with "HIIT Tabatas" 77, "4x4 Norwegian training" 77, and "time outside in nature" (user query).

This presents a design contradiction: a traditional "dojo" implies "minimal decor, pale tones, and straight lines" 37—a space of human-imposed *order*. "Nature" implies organic, complex, and "messy" *systems*.40

The 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' (Symbiotic) strategy *resolves* this contradiction. The solution is the **Biophilic Dojo**: a "Nature Gym" 44 that is not a commercial "green gym" 45, but a dedicated *practice space* that "balances tradition with modern design".37 It will have the *soul* and "authenticity" 37 of a traditional dojo, but will be built with "natural materials" 42 (FSC wood, cork, bamboo), "natural light" 40, and direct views and access to the permaculture landscape.

The HIIT/4x4 training 77 is thus performed *in* this "restorative" 41 environment. The training is not "in a box"; it is an interaction with the "living organism" 15 of the home, reinforcing the mind-body-environment symbiosis.

## **Part 4: Operationalizing the Vision: Kaizen-DevOps and The Resilient Platform**

This section details the *process* (the "how-to") for the 35-year project. It merges the tech-inspired strategies—'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%), 'Agile' (12%), 'Utilidor' (10%), 'Pace Layering' (9%), and 'Modular Zone' (5%)—into a single, resilient operational methodology.

### **4.1. The Kaizen-DevOps (15%) Philosophy: The Daily Practice**

The 35-year project of "small atomic daily tasks" is defined by the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) strategy. This is a synthesis of two philosophies:

1. **Kaizen (改善):** The Japanese philosophy of "continuous improvement".47 It is "founded on the premise that tiny, continual positive adjustments may yield substantial results".48 It applies to "working life, our social life, our home life" 47, transforming daily "maintenance" from a chore into a practice of "change for the better".50  
2. **DevOps:** A set of practices from software development that "remov\[es\] the barriers between... development and operations".52 Its key principles are "Automation" 12, "Continuous Feedback Loops" 12, "End-to-End Responsibility" 12, and "Infrastructure as Code".12

The 'Kaizen-DevOps' strategy (Strategy \#2) dictates that every 45-minute "maintenance" task ('Kaizen') *also* includes a "refactoring" component ('DevOps'). The goal is not just to *perform* the task, but to *improve the process*, making the *next* iteration of the task easier, faster, or obsolete.

The daily "ground rules" for this practice will be the **Kaizen 5S method** 55:

* ***Seiri*** **(Sort):** Eliminate the unnecessary.  
* ***Seiton*** **(Set in Order):** A place for everything, and everything in its place.50  
* ***Seiso*** **(Shine):** Clean the workspace (the entire home).50  
* ***Seiketsu*** **(Standardize):** Create a consistent process.50  
* ***Shitsuke*** **(Sustain):** "Internalise each step" 50 to make the practice a "habit".50

This methodology will be applied to the *entire* home, from the workshop 56 and kitchen 50 to the dojo, where "cleanliness \[is\] at the core".37

This system is uniquely suited to the "homesteading" (user query) goal. Homesteading is a system of "seasonally recurring jobs" and a "list that only ever gets larger" 59, which is a source of "struggle" and stress for many.59 For this project, that "problem" *is the feature*. The 10,000-task backlog *is* the "Dojo"; it is the *engine* for Kaizen 51, providing a 35-year domain for "continuous improvement".11

### **4.2. The Foundational Platform (10%): Utilidor and 'Infrastructure as Code'**

The 'Foundational Platform' (Utilidor) strategy (10%) is the physical implementation of the 35-year 'Kaizen-DevOps' philosophy. A "utilidor," or "utility corridor" 61, is a "dedicated underground tunnel... to house multiple utility lines in a controlled and protected environment".13

The "initial capital costs are notably higher" 13 than traditional trenching. However, for a 35-year (or 100-year) project, the "operation and maintenance costs" 13 are drastically lower because the design "significantly reduces the need for future excavations" 13 and provides "streamlined access for maintenance and upgrades".13

This is the key physical-technical synthesis: The 'Utilidor' (Strategy \#10) is the *physical expression* of the DevOps principle 'Infrastructure as Code' (IaC) (Strategy \#2, 15%).63

'Infrastructure as Code' is a "fundamental principle of DevOps... \[to\] treat infrastructure the same way developers treat code".63 Infrastructure is "defined in a declarative way and stored in a source control system" 63, making provisioning "repeatable, reliable, or consistent".63 The 'Utilidor' *physically manifests* this. It abstracts the home's "services" (plumbing, electrical, data) from its "structure." It allows the inhabitant to treat the physical utilities as "reusable modules" 66 that can be "refactored," upgraded, or "redeployed" 67 with the "rigor, clarity, and reliability" 63 of software, and without "disruptive surface excavations".13

### **4.3. The Resilient Architecture: Pace Layering (9%) and Modular Zones (5%)**

This operational framework is designed to *evolve* over 35 years. The 'Pace Layering' (9%) and 'Modular Zone' (5%) strategies define this evolutionary capacity.

Stewart Brand's 'Pace Layering' model 7 is the central concept. It posits that "robust and adaptable" 7 systems are composed of "different parts... \[that\] change at different speeds".7 Brand's "architectural" version 8 defines six layers:

* **Site:** The plot of land (changes geologically).  
* **Structure:** The foundation and load-bearing elements (changes slowly, if ever).  
* **Skin:** The exterior surfaces (changes every \~20 years).  
* **Services:** The plumbing, electrical, and HVAC (changes every \~7-15 years).  
* **Space Plan:** The interior walls (changes every \~3-10 years).  
* **Stuff:** The furniture (changes daily/monthly).

The "health" of the system "is in the contradictions between these layers".68 "Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes, slow disposes... Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power".7

The 'Utilidor' (Strategy \#10) is the *key* to implementing the 'Pace Layering' (Strategy \#9) model. Its *entire purpose* is to **de-couple the 'Services' layer from the 'Structure' layer**.8 In a conventional home, the "fast" 'Services' (e.g., a burst pipe, an-internet upgrade) are "stuck" inside the "slow" 'Structure' (the walls, the foundation slab). This *blocks* "refactoring" and makes change "disruptive".13 The 'Utilidor' 13 *liberates* the 'Services' layer, allowing it to "refactor" 8 at its own "fast pace" without ever disturbing the "slow" 'Structure'.8 This is the *core* of the 35-year project's resilience.

The 'Modular Zone' (Service Port) strategy (5%) is the *micro-level implementation* of this system. It applies the 'microservice' 52 software architecture concept to the home. Each "zone" (kitchen, dojo, studio) is a "microservice" 52 that "publishes" its utility needs (water, power, data) to the 'Utilidor' 13 via a "standardized utility port." This allows for 'Agile Refactoring' (Strategy \#3) of a *single zone* without taking the *entire system* offline.

## **Part 5: The Foundational Backlog: 100 Research Sprints for the 35-Year Project**

This section constitutes the "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5) for the 10,000-day project. The 100 topics are organized into "Epics" (collections of related tasks) that align with the 'Lighthouse Vision'. Each topic is a "research sprint"—a focused unit of work for the inhabitant in their "spare time" (user query). The 4-sentence explanation accompanying each topic defines the research and its role in "programming" the desired non-materialist, creative, and disciplined lifestyle.
