### **Epic 2: Kaizen-DevOps Operations (The 35-Year Process)**

*(This epic defines the 'how'—the daily operational philosophy for the 10,000-day project. It merges the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) and 'Agile' (12%) strategies.)*

11. Kaizen Philosophy for Home Life 11  
    This sprint studies the core philosophy of 'Kaizen' 11 as "continuous improvement" 47 applied to "our social life, our home life".49 It is "founded on the idea that small, incremental changes routinely applied... result in significant improvements".11 This research trains the mindset to see every "atomic daily task" 51 not as a chore, but as an opportunity for a "change for the better".50 This is the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) strategy in its purest form.  
12. The 5S Methodology for Domestic Space 50  
    This sprint is a deep dive into the practical 5S method: Seiri (Sort), Seiton (Set in Order), Seiso (Shine), Seiketsu (Standardize), and Shitsuke (Sustain).50 This is the "how-to" for the daily 'Kaizen' 11 tasks, creating a "place for everything, and everything in its place".56 This system "programs" the "dojo mindset" 37 of "cleanliness" 37, order, and efficiency into the entire domestic environment, from the kitchen 50 to the workshop.56  
13. DevOps Principles for Physical Systems 12  
    This sprint researches how to translate 'DevOps' principles 12 from software to the physical home. This includes "Automation" 12 of home systems, "Continuous Feedback" 12 (e.g., sensors in the permaculture garden), "Version Control for All Assets" 12 (via the 'Digital Twin', Strategy \#2), and "End-to-End Responsibility".12 This research provides the "operations" 69 half of the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) strategy. It programs a mindset of "systems thinking" 54 and "continuous improvement".53  
14. 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11  
    This sprint synthesizes the core 15% strategy. It's about designing a "holistic approach" 69 where every 45-minute "maintenance" task 11 also includes a "refactoring" component.12 The research will focus on process design: "How does this 'Kaizen' 11 task 15 provide "feedback" 12 that allows me to "refactor" the system to be better?" This "programs" a mindset of "continuous evolution" (Strategy \#2).  
15. Agile Refactoring (Scrum) for Home Projects  
    This sprint studies 'Agile' 12 and 'Scrum' (Strategy \#3) methodology and applies it to the home. This involves setting up 7-year "Epochs" (Strategy \#8) as "Releases," 1-year "Refactoring Sprints" (Strategy \#3), and 2-week "Sprints" for daily tasks. The 10,000 tasks will be managed in a "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5). This 'Agile' (12%) strategy "programs" the 35-year project, making it manageable, "iterative" (user query), and "adaptive" 19 to "unexpected" 19 changes.  
16. Homesteading as a Kaizen Practice 51  
    This sprint researches how the 'Kaizen' 51 philosophy is applied on "year-round vegetable farm\[s\]" 60 to manage the "list that only ever gets larger".59 This directly addresses the "homesteading" 87 goal. This research "programs" the mindset to reframe the "overwhelming" 59 nature of homesteading from a source of stress into the perfect engine for "continuous, incremental improvements" 51 ('Kaizen', 15%).  
17. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Home Systems 63  
    This sprint researches the software side of the 'Utilidor' (10%) strategy. It involves learning 'IaC' 63 tools 66 to "programmatically" manage the home's "smart" systems.8 This means treating the home's configuration "the same way developers treat code" 63, making it "repeatable" 65 and "versioned".63 This is the 'DevOps' 12 "automation" 64 principle applied to the "chassis".13  
18. The 'Dynamic Backlog' (AI-Curated) Strategy  
    This sprint investigates AI assistant tools (like GPT-4, etc.) that can "curate" (Strategy \#5) the 10,000-task "Dynamic Backlog" (10%). The AI will be tasked with scanning for "new tech" (Strategy \#5) (e.g., new 'Bio-Mimetic' 9 materials, new 'n-of-1' 89 tracking tools) and "suggesting" (Strategy \#5) new 'Kaizen' 11 tasks that align with the 'Lighthouse Vision' (Strategy \#9). This "programs" the 'Kaizen-DevOps' (15%) "continuous evolution" (Strategy \#2) by automating the "search for improvements."  
19. The 'Epoch' (Technological Era) Strategy  
    This sprint is for planning the 35-year project in 7-year "Epochs" (Strategy \#8). This "refactoring sprint" (Strategy \#3) involves defining the "Tech Stack" (Strategy \#8) for "Epoch 1" (e.g., current solar, 'IaC' 63 tools) and forecasting the "Great Refactor" (Strategy \#8) for "Epoch 3" (e.g., replacing Gen1 solar with Gen3 perovskite solar). This 'Pace Layering' 8 approach "programs" the mindset to expect and plan for technological "revolutions" 7 rather than be disrupted by them.  
20. The 'Lighthouse Vision' (Dynamic Roadmap) Strategy  
    This is the "meta" sprint, focused on the process of reviewing the 'Lighthouse Vision' (3%) itself. This "annual review" (Strategy \#9) ensures the 35-year "why" 107 remains fixed, while the "how" (the 'Dynamic Roadmap', Strategy \#9) is "refactored yearly based on new tech" (Strategy \#9). This sprint "programs" the discipline of 'Kaizen' 11 and 'Agile' (Strategy \#3) "self-renewal" 19 into the project's highest level, ensuring the 10,000-day project never deviates from its "anti-materialist" (user query) core.
