### **Epic 5: The Permaculture Potager (The 'Homesteading' & 'Garden' Life)**

*(This epic implements the "permaculture," "gardening," and "homesteading" goals. It reframes the garden as a "living dojo" and a place of mindfulness, directly supporting the 40% 'Bio-Mimetic' strategy.)*

41. Permaculture Philosophy as a Worldview 24  
    This sprint researches permaculture "not \[as\] a variation of organic gardening" 24, but as a "way to view the world" 81 and a "design system" 21 for "sustainable human environments".21 It is the "art of making connections" 24 and "noticing systems".81 This "Lighthouse" (Strategy \#9) research "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) mindset, grounding the 10,000-day project in the "Earth Care" 23 ethics.  
42. Permaculture as Mindful Practice 31  
    This sprint focuses on the mindset programming of permaculture. It's about "intentional observation" 81 and "mindful attention".81 "Gardening" 31 is reframed as a "meditative practice" 31 that cultivates "being present" 31 and a "flow state".82 This "programs" the mind to observe the 'Symbiotic Home' 10 system, "identify patterns" 82, and "apply self regulation and accept feedback".8112  
43. The 'Potager' (Kitchen Garden) Philosophy 83  
    This sprint researches the history and design of the French "potager".85 It is not a "farm".60 It is an aesthetic "tasting garden" 83 that "intermingle\[s\] vegetables, fruits, herbs, medicinal... and flowers" 85 in "symmetrical" 112 beds. This "programs" the "artist's studio" 36 mindset, reframing the "homesteading" 87 goal as an act of art.7  
44. Designing the Potager 'Dojo' 83  
    This sprint defines the 'Potager' 85 as a "living dojo".37 The design will be "symmetrical" 112, "enclosed" 83, and "a space you do not want to leave".84 The "daily tasks" 83 (planting, weeding, harvesting) are the 'kata' 4 of this 'Dojo'.37 This "programs" the mindset by "painting a picture with plants" 86, turning "maintenance" (user query) into a "meditative practice" 31 of "creativity".86  
45. Homesteading 101: Core Practices 87  
    This sprint researches the foundational "homesteading" 87 skills. This includes "methods of food preservation" 87 (canning, dehydrating), "self-sufficiency" 87, and daily "animal care".8888 This research provides the content for the 'Kaizen-DevOps' 11 "Dynamic Backlog" (Strategy \#5) of daily tasks. This "programs" the practical "homesteading" 87 lifestyle.  
46. Integrating Permaculture and Biophilic Design 23  
    This sprint explores the "symbiotic" 10 relationship between permaculture 21 and 'biophilic design'.23 The 'Potager' 83 will be designed as the primary 'biophilic' "view" 40 from the 'Dojo' 37 and 'Studio'.36 This "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy, "reconnecting people with nature" 23 by visually and functionally "blurring boundaries".27  
47. Urban & Residential Agriculture Policy 26  
    This is a practical 'Governance' 113 layer sprint into local "zoning policy".26 This research is necessary to ensure the "homesteading" 87 and "permaculture" 26 goals 26 are legally viable (Strategy \#4, 'Legal Paperwork') on the 'Site'.8 This "programs" the 'Kaizen' 11 mindset of "planning and preparation".11  
48. Vertical Gardening and Trellising 84  
    This sprint researches how to "utilize every space" 84 in the 'Potager' 83 by "growing vertically".84 This involves using "natural material" 8484 and "salvaged material" 84 to create "arches" 84 and "teepee trellis\[es\]".84 This "programs" the "artist's" 86 and 'Kaizen' 1119 mindsets, "adding... depth to the space" 84 while maximizing "self-sufficiency".87  
49. 'Fair Share' 23 and Regenerative Living 28  
    This sprint focuses on the "permaculture ethic" 23 of "Fair Share": "equitably distributing resources and sharing surplus".23 This involves researching systems for "regenerative living" 28 and "sharing" 23 the 'Potager' 83 harvest. This "programs" the "anti-materialist" (user query) mindset, linking the 'Potager' 83 (production) to the 'Service' 102105 epic.  
50. The 'Zone 0' Permaculture/Architecture Link 25  
    This sprint researches the "boundary between permaculture and architecture".25 Permaculture's "Zone 0" is the house.25 This sprint will analyze how to design the 'Structure' 8 and 'Skin' 8 of the house itself as the "center of the permaculture system".21 This "programs" the 'Bio-Mimetic' (40%) strategy at the deepest level, making the "house" 15 and "garden" 83 "one symbiotic, self-refactoring system" (Strategy \#1).
